I've had Nike's before and have always been pleased with the comfort, performance, and quality. Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first, so I was nervous. But this turned out to be a great choice. Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration. Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning, but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient. Love these, highly recommend!","I have been using these for over 30 years and I was delighted and surprised when I tried them. I found their comfort level to be very good, and I didn't feel like spending too much on them. I have a long history"

Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.

If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.

I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.

They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(

I am 5' 4"" and 159 pounds and I ordered a medium.  The size fit perfectly although that being said they are longer on me than the photo (probably my short legs) but came 2 inches above my ankle so just below my calf.  Given that I have weight to loose these are very flattering on as well.  They are also a nice stretchy fabric (thus the comfort) and cool.  We are in the high 90's and 100 degree summer weather and I am cool!  Purchase these as you won't be disappointed especially at this price.  I like these better than my Lululemon and Athleta capris!!!  I am back to purchase more!","I like Capris. It is a very comfortable, medium size. I have calf muscles that are slightly oversized, but still comfortable. I recommend it in any case. It is warm to the ankle, which is the"
ring | day | order | delivery | date | finish | seller | business,My ring shipped the same day that I placed the order and was received well before the estimated delivery date. It is absolutely beautiful!! It is a substantial ring without being overly heavy and is very comfortable to wear. I've cooked and cleaned with it on and it is still free of scratches and the finish is beautifully shiny. It also runs true to size. I highly recommend this ring and this seller!! Will definitely do business with them again.,"I received ringtones for the first time and I couldn't believe the date. I had been waiting for it to arrive, and I couldn't believe the other day. I had been able to order them again. This"
change | review | washing | size | fit | toe | snug | problem | quality | price | set | stocking,"I am changing my review after a second washing.
I am a male size 9 wide and after washing  they are a very tight fit. They are mid calf, wide enough at the toe, but snug from toe to heel. That said I think a male size 8 is about it. Larger size feet might have a problem. Quality is OK for the price. You will see these socks sold singly on other sites at $12.99 each!  I like the socks and ordered a second set to put in my daughters Christmas stocking.","I am so disappointed that Avon discontinued this product because I didn't feel it fit in my toe. I wanted to use it sparingly so as not to use it up too quickly. Sadly, my small size was too"
shoe | sole | feeling | bend | foot | ankle | pain | color | mesh | summer,Favorite Nike shoe ever! The flex sole is excellent for someone like me who loves the free feeling of sandals or being barefoot. These move effortlessly with the bend of my foot. I've worn these for multiple activities and I've had no foot or ankle pain. The white/green/dark grey color goes with so many outfits and the mesh breathes perfectly on hot summer days. Highly recommend!,"I have a pair of pairs of flat footshoes that are comfortable but don't have the feeling of being pushed too much. I feel like this shoe is kind of cliche, especially in the summer months. I"
fault | read | fiber | content | shirt | touch | manufacturer | course,"Largely my fault for not reading carefully, but the high synthetic fiber content made the shirt uncomfortable to the touch.  Not the manufacturer's fault, of course.","I have a fault with reading fiber, and I have to find a way to fix it. I use fiber primarily for cleaning and the shirt itself. I am not a big fan, so I have to take some time to"
