fry | flavor | bottle | beer | type | cap,I have just used this on a stir fry and was pleasantly surprised with the good flavor. The bloody bottle was hard to open because it had a beer type cap which seemed to not want to let go. But what's inside is what counts and the flavor is excellent. Highly recommended.,"I like how afrier I can flavor this drink. I don't have a specific bottle, so I bought one. I think the beers in the bottle are kind of small for a beer, but I think they"
vareity | flavor | meat | vegetable | blend,A great vareity of Magic Blends. Each one brings a nice flavor to the meat that is recommended. The vegetable blend is used daily on just about every vegetable I eat. Very flavorful and tasty.

Inca Kola has a taste leaning toward 'creme soda,"" with a look like Mt. Dew.  However, when in Peru, I tried to drink the diet version whenever possible (which I couldn't find very often).

soup | scene | make | rookie | spoonful | water | day | viewpoint | course | spoon | heat | gas | world | difference,"I'm new to the miso soup scene and was making possibly the biggest rookie mistake ever. I would just whisk a big spoonful of miso into hot water and call it a day. You can image why I thought I just didn't like miso. This changed my whole viewpoint, of course. A spoon of this, bring it to a good heat (but not boil), turn off the gas, add your miso, add your toppings, done. Delicious. Truly makes a world of difference.","I love this soup scene! It's a rookie made spoonful, and I had to give it four stars as the spoonful is almost 3x the size of the real spoon. I have a very different viewpoint"

tea | lot | flavor | bit | bitterness | morning | afternoon | soy | milk | sugar,"I like this tea a lot. It has full bodied black tea flavor, and only a little bit of bitterness. It's the perfect tea to start off your morning or to drink as a pick me up in the afternoon. I usually add a bit of soy or almond milk to it, and a bit of sugar to combat the bitterness. It is much less bitter than other plain black teas I have tried.","I like Tetea, which has a lot of flavor, but not a lot. It's a lot bittersweeter than any other soy milk product I've tried. I found it to be very sweet"

problem | product | light | home | daylight | food | clothing | makeup | outside | go | house | bathroom | streetwalker | read,"The problem is not in the product. It's the light in your home. Colors appear differently in artificial light than they do in natural light (daylight). This happens to everything, not just food. It happens to clothing and even makeup. Purple colors are most affected by this. What looks like a pretty purple outside is going to look black inside the house.

Beware if you have rose colored bulbs in your bathroom. Your makeup is going to look like you are a streetwalker. (Get some daylight bulbs, ""warm"" is more yellow or lightbulby, ""cool"" is more blue-whitish or sunlighty).

bar | fruity | treat | texture | workout | cooler | downside | energy | bottle | water,"I really enjoyed this bar. It was a sweet and fruity treat that I enjoyed.  The texture was a little gritty but not bad at all.  Infact, I barely noticed it.  The bar itself was soft which is nice when you are tired after a workout.  I could see that this bar would harden if I kept it in the cooler.

The only downside was that I did not feel any extra amount of energy.  I basically felt as replenished as I do with any bar I eat.  I was satisfied with this and a bottle of water.

This was definitely a flavorful treat that I would reccomend to anyone.","I like Bare Minerals bar as it is sweet and fruity, but this treat is more of a treat than the usual bar. It has a very light texture and it doesn't get any cooler. On the plus side"
sauce | collection | difference | heat | pain | dog | silver | collector | drive | nail | tongue | school | girl | pea | drop | effect | motor | oil | stuff,"GZ is the most painful sauce in my collection (until I recently got The Final Answer).  There is a difference between heat and pain.  I consider the mad dog silver collector sauce to be extreme heat.  This, is pain.  It feels like someone is driving a nail through your tongue. Pepperheads know this sauce by name, and for me, it's the only sauce that releases those endorphins and gets me all giddy like a school-girl.

I have noticed that you really need about a pea-sized drop to get the full effect.  Any smaller and you might be disappointed.  Non-seasoned pepperheads should not really try this sauce.

I find this sauce to be the most disgusting in my collection too.  It's what I imagine motor oil tastes like.  It's really just for heat this stuff.","I love thissauce collection. It makes me feel like there is no difference in the heat and pain that comes from using it. If you are a dog owner, this collector has the right tools to help me keep my nails or nails"

style | flavor | feedback | way,"These are the old-fashioned style of Va. peanuts, lightly roasted, large and full of flavor.  If you like brown roasted Planters, don't buy these.  And don't leave negative feedback if you buy these and they aren't roasted as much as you like.  They are not supposed to be.  These are perfect, the way Williamsburg and other Va. peanuts used to be before they went national and overroasted their peanuts to sell to the Planters buyers.",I really like this style.

Learning from his misfortune, I took a few tinefulls (on the tip of a fork) on my taco . . . not even a full drop as recommended.  Just the perfect amount.  Two hours later, I still feel a nice lingering heat.

As for flavor, I think serranos have a better flavor, but this wasn't bad.  I definitely would put a very very small on any food where I wanted that perfect amount of ""burn"".

You also may notice that only people from Texas and California have written reviews.  This sauce really is for people who grew up eating Mexican and Southwestern food.  I don't know if a New Yorker or someone from the Mid West would enjoy this stuff.","I recently had this amazing taco from Whole Foods and this taco is every bit as yummy! I don't recommend eating tacos at all, I mean seriously. It's heavenly. I don't recommend eating"

tea | have | trouble | boiling | water | problem | work | brand | today | sweetening | box | follow | oz | pitcher | peach | taste | make | combination | comment | product | sachet | sock | linen | closet | bag | sip,"I adore iced tea, but dislike having to go to all the trouble of boiling water to steep it.  This is especially a problem at work.  I saw these cold-brewed teas, and since this particular brand had all the good reviews, decided to try it.  I was tickled when it arrived today.

Yuk!  Tastes like Kool-Aid, without the sweetening.  It smells pretty good in the box, but once you ""brew"" it, following the directions on the box (1 -2 bags per 8 oz. of cool water -- I used two bags per 8 oz. because I like my iced tea strong -- and steep for ten minutes.)  After ten minutes I had a pitcher full of colored water with a weak slightly-bitter artificial peach taste.  Really gross.

Guess I'm back to boiling water and making my pitcher of iced tea with a combination of black tea and Constant Comment -- yum!

I definitely don't recommend this product.  Now I'm stuck with four big boxes of it. Maybe I can use it as sachet in my kids' sock drawers or in between sheets in the linen closet or something like that.  It really does smell nice when it's dry in the bag in the box. Just don't drink it.

Ewww -- just took another sip.  DOUBLE YUK!","I have tried a variety of products and I was really sad when I received this one. I was really sad that I had to return this product because I didn't want to spend much on it. I instead, I used this instead"

flavor | tea | taste | remove | aftertaste | sugar | bitterness | health | have | shame | pumpkin | box | opinion | bit | cup | friend | water | try | afterall | buy,"I like the flavor of this tea. It has a pumpkin taste that's not covered up by the spices. With that being said, I'm removing two stars because of the bitter aftertaste of stevia. I wish they would leave it out completely. I have to add sugar to cut the bitterness, and for health reasons I prefer not to add sugar to tea. Because of having to add sugar, unfortunately this won't be a tea I drink very often, which is a shame since its the only pumpkin tea I can find that actually tastes like pumpkin rather than chai.

***Updated: So I'm through one entire box of this and my opinion has been downgraded a bit. Each cup I enjoyed less and less. Of course that's because a friend gave me a few bags of Bigelow Pumpkin Spice tea which blows this out of the water and no bitter aftertaste. So while I think this tea is worth a try (we all have different tastes afterall), it's not one I will be buying again.","I agree with several of the other reviewers. The pumpkin flavor is very similar, but there are too few of the aftertastes to be of any real sweetness. I do wish that the sugar free taste was removed, but aftert"

For some reason, a lot of the best sauces come from FL. If you want something hotter, my suggestion would be to try the famous Scorpion fruit used in Fat Cat (brand) Chairman Meow's Revenge. But Gator is pretty excellent, and just right for those people like me who are a little picky about their hot sauces (and have tried a ton of them).","I've been using this for about 1 month and I got a lot of compliments.

color | butter | flavor | baking | pancake | rest | vegetable | oil | alteration | use | time | achieve | substitution | recipe | moderation | work | try | animal | fat,"I use the Wilton no-color butter flavor in baking, pancake, waffles, but not by itself. For recipes that call for butter, I use half or 1/3 the butter that's called for, and substitute the rest with vegetable oil. And with that alteration, I add the Wilton butter flavor to supplement the butter flavor. I love butter and use to eat loads of it all the time. But some recipes call for so much of it, I want to cut down. This butter helps me achieving that.

Since this is not real butter, it is understandable such substitution may not suit every recipe. Some baking would not come out the same without fluffy butter. But for the ones that simply requires the butter flavor, the Wilton butter flavor helps. It is not the same, but it helps. I have not used this in things that are not cooked. So can't really speak to that. For anything artificial, I only use in moderation. So far, it's been working great. This is not easy to find in local stores. Luckily, Amazon has in. For anyone who's trying to cut down on butter or animal fat, give this a try.","I use color-free butter as part of my everyday cooking.

It is a rather small container, but after going through an entire container of awase miso paste, I still have over half of this container left.

My husband bought a bowl of cut up fruit at a snack bar and there was a little packet of this stuff in there. I love it. It's spicy, not unbearably hot (I can only take so much heat in my food, and this is bearable), has a bit of sour from lime and counterbalances the sweetness of fruit with salt. I eat a lot of apples with this stuff on it. I slice a whole apple up, and sprinkle it on. I probably have about 7-10 apples a week now, because I prefer this type of snack to chips or ice cream!

tree | company | shape | ficus | light | apartment | water | day | time | routiine | plant | pot | room | spray | bottle | patience | choice | travel,"The first tree I ordered was badly scarred by wires.  The company replaced it quickly with a very nice tree that had a great shape.  The ficus is great if you have little natural light.  My apartment is very dark and the tree did fine off of the artificial light.  That said, this is NOT a tree for beginners.  Ficus are notoriously finicky.  They like regular water and the same light conditions day after day.  Each time you vary the routiine significantly, it will drop all of its leaves.  Moreover, this plant was hard to water.  The pot doesn't have enough room for the water to soak in, so I had to use a spray bottle and lots of patience.  It needs to be watered daily.

In short: good choice if you just don't have any good light, bad, bad choice for a first Bonsai or if you are forgetful or travel.","I am a fan of this company and would love to find something that is right for me.

Because the chicory in this blend is fairly prominent, I usually make my coffee au lait style. Actually, I make it more like cafe Cubano with scalded or steamed milk, but that is a personal preference. If you have never tried a chicory blended coffee you may want to at least use a little cream or milk and a touch of sugar, even if you normally take your coffee black. Once you grow accustomed to the chicory you can cut back on the additives until you can enjoy it straight up. I'll forewarn you, though, that once you develop a taste for this you will get cravings at the oddest times.

Chicory in coffee was practically the de facto blend when I was growing up in Virginia. It's a traditional flavor throughout the south and especially New Orleans. I do not often drink this coffee, but when I have a craving this is the only brand that I trust.

Without the extract the flavor is barely noticeable; the extract makes all the difference.

I found this to be a very good extract.  I've only used it in coconut macaroons, with this extract - just a half teaspoon - vanilla extract, and salt being the only flavors added (to the sugar, shredded coconut, egg whites and a bit of flour), and it made for very tasty macaroons.  Nothing overpowering to the flavor, just enough to contribute nicely to the overall taste, blending nicely with the coconut and vanilla.  Glass bottle, not plastic, and I always appreciate organic when it's available.  Not a lot more to say, but I can certainly recommend this product.","I was pleased with the Update bottle.

As well, this extract is kosher, gluten free, allergen free and GMO free.  So why only 4 stars if it is so wonderful?  Well, they added sugar to this extract--an ingredient that is so not necessary.

I was able to scrape away the extra purple/blackish color and repair the whipped cream frosting, but I regret trying this product -- so I caution you if you need a dark color. When I was ordering for cake-decorating, the Color Mist had seemed likely to be the easiest way to decorate the cake top with a stencil. As it turns out, my back-up plan -- colored sugar -- actually worked much better.

The first few times I cooked it in the microwave, it exploded all over the place and left a sticky mess (Cooked it on high for 3 minutes as the instructions read). Covering it with a plate or foil does not help. I figured out that stirring after the 1st and 2nd minute prevents it from boiling over. You do have to let it sit for several minutes before it's cool enough to eat.

The texture of this cereal is very grainy, which can not be helped by adding more liquid. I add splenda and fat free yogurt to give it better taste and texture, sometimes I slice some banana into it before I cook it.

heat | sauce | drop | way | opening | bottle | overdose | dish | number | array | lineup | chile | case | center | look | label | ingredient | pepper | water | vinegar | include | purchase | fan | taste | testing | year | everybody | hobby | mediocre | purpose | substitute | mind | hint | garlic | bit | sugar,"If you want considerable heat and little else this could be your sauce. One drop goes a long way BUT given the fairly large opening on the bottle you easily risk overdosing a dish.

El Yucateco produces a large number of hot sauces - a dizzying array and among their lineup are a number of what I would call ""pure"" hot sauces. By ""pure"" - I mean - the chile (in this case - the Habanero) is up front and center. Looking at the ingredients listed on the label of this particular hot sauce - the first ingredient (which means it is the main ingredient, as required by labeling laws) is the Habanero pepper. The next ingredient is water. That is unusual - most hot sauces have water as their main ingredient and often feature large quantities of vinegar too. All too often, the actual chile pepper becomes a minor ingredient in many hot sauces including some El Yucateco sauces.

This is a very nice hot sauce particularly if you simply want to avoid purchasing actual Habanero peppers. But be aware, this sauce is very hot and you could easily overdose a dish.

Yet, I'm not a big fan of the Habanero chile but you may be. El Yucateco also produces an excellent Chipotle and Jalapeo hot sauce. I prefer both sauces/chiles to the Habanero. What I can say is El Yucateco makes some great sauces - often true to the chile they feature.

In many categories - El Yucateco excels. I've been taste testing 40 different hot sauces for over a year now (everybody needs a hobby) and often El Yucateco comes out a favorite although their array of hot sauces is so extensive it is hard to select their best from the merely mediocre.

Nevertheless, as a general purpose hot sauce I prefer the Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce over this one! As noted: the El Yucateco Jalapeo and Chipotle hot sauces are also excellent but taste quite different from this sauce and are no where near as potent. Yet - I personally prefer all three of the above to this particular hot sauce.

If you want a substitute for this sauce which is just as potent but superior in my mind - then try Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. Yet it tastes different with a hint of garlic and a bit of sugar.

If you simply love the taste of the Habanero and want that pure taste - this is your sauce","I am a diehard chile fan. This sauce is so delicious, and I'm so happy to find that I can find it. I'm a bit overdosier than most of the other brands I"

If you like the distinctive flavor of bergamont, but wish it were more pronounced than in the conventional blend, and your not opposed to some extra tannins, then this or Rishi are your Earl Greys of choice.  Of the conventional Earl Grey teas that are relatively easy to find, my favorite is Bigelow's. My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution, and includes lavender as an ingredient. However, I have to knock Revolution by trying cut costs by not including a string with their tea bags. If you want to try an Earl with a unique citrus zing, go for Stash Double Bergamont. I think it includes grapefruit flavoring (just my perception). Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version.

And in-order to protect its allies and the mad-profit driven industry they have openly banned apricot fruits, seeds and even the TREES in 2002, these attacked includes armed raids, deportation, exiles, threats, shut downs, secret assassinations, health professionals license suspended, revoke and by other or any means necessary. Because apricot-seeds had been published as a CURE For Cancer. Curing cancer or any disease is ILLEGAL in America. The British government soon followed suit. Many Innocent people in both countries were arrested and wrongfully charged as criminals for merely selling apricot seeds, a carrier of vitamin B-17.

The reason for the exploding popularity of vitamin B-17, and thereby bitter almonds, was all due to the fact, that vitamin B-17 has dramatic and miraculous tumor-cancer killing properties. So, in 2007, the F.D.A. made the claim that raw almonds had been linked to TWO salmonella outbreaks in the past 500 years, and that all almonds needed to be PASTEURIZED For Safety. Almonds had suddenly become dangerous and an enemy of the death squad industry that feeds off and needs its victims (patients) in-order to survive. Versus, the pharmaceutical chemicals, radiation and nuclear poisons that have crippled, mutilated, destroyed and killed its millions, and have committed crimes and atrocity against humanity.

But, here is the kicker, never before in history had any nation practiced the absurdity of pasteurizing dry (even salted) nuts, fruits or seeds by FORCE. Americans cannot domestically buy raw almonds or fruits for food anymore, and much more importantly, Americans are being prevented from using bitter almonds (vitamin B-17) to cure their owned sick body from cancers. Judging from the F.D.A.'s bizarre aggression towards almonds which contain intact vitamin B-17, and apricot seeds, it is easy to conclude just how powerful and effective vitamin B-17 is for curing cancers, at least for those of us who are knowledgeable about the F.D.A.'s unwavering history of destroying and censoring ALL effective NATURAL, Herbal or other treatments or CURES. Only to protect the big-evil 3s (Big Pharma, AMA & ACS), well 4 if you include Satan, whom only purpose is to kill, steal and destroy. And they have done a good, well an excellent job so far, while wrecking in major wealth and profit. What a mind job!!??

Despite the outrage, floods of phone calls and letters of disapproval to the U.S.D.A. and the F.D.A., All almonds sold inside the U.S. must now be PASTEURIZED, Chemicalized, Bleached, Tainted & Poisoned. These same agencies have notified food producers that they should DISHONESTLY label their pasteurized almonds as 'RAW' (the opposite of pasteurized), and that the food producers will get the government's full BLESSINGS. Therefore, almonds in the United States which are labeled as 'RAW', are deceptively labeled, and you should do your own research and expose and boycott all the companies that participate in this deception, corruption and sham.
Most almonds are pasteurized with PROPYLENE OXIDE other producers used other chemicals/poisons. Propylene oxide is a known carcinogen, and it is on California's Proposition 65 list of chemicals that cause cancer and reproductive harm. This means that the majority of almonds sold within the U.S. are not only nutritionally neutralized, but they contain dangerous chemical byproducts as well, which cause cancers and other diseases. Before the F.D.A. decreed that almonds must be tainted, almonds were so healthful that they could cure cancer without side effects in most test subjects.

Follow-up research shows that, MOST Whole Foods Market only sells bitter almonds that are pasteurized by STEAM!? which is an improvement over the poisonous pasteurization methods; but it still DEGRADES AND DESTROYS the nutritional value of the almonds, and of course, it eliminates ALL or most of the vitamin B-17. There is usually no way to know which method was used for pasteurization at most retailers, because the pertinent labeling laws were made to benefit the chemical industry, and deceive consumers. Because the FDA have instructed food producers that they should dishonestly label their PASTEURIZED almonds as 'RAW'.
Today, Almond Seeds, Vitamin B-17 has technically become LEGAL in the United States again, Well ONLY after it has been tainted, bleached, chemicalized, poisons and pasteurized.

Do your own research. Also, misuse or improper use of concentrated B-17/laetrile may be harmful in some situations. Those with liver or kidney cancers should be mindful in the use of vitamin B-17, because it can place additional stress upon these organs, and such patients may be unable to tolerate it.","I was fascinated by the 'Star Trek' propaganda. It explains how easily I can get such a large body mass without the help of a doctor. But in reality, the greatest occult is still active. It"

order | today | plastic | open | potato | baking | sheet | oven | cheese | fill | crispy | way | microwave | cook | deal | website | addition | box | site | shipping | future | plus | corn | syrup | rarity | food | product | grocery | store | example | butter | cream | degree | quality | fat | bacon | expect | fiber | half,"I received 4 of these in my first ever Omaha Steaks order that I received today. I wasn't sure what to expect, but so far, I've been pleased. I tore the plastic open, put the frozen potato on a baking sheet in the oven and put it on 350. 45 minutes later it was done and turned out being delicious. The cheese filling was crispy on-top and the potato itself underneath was nice and soft. No way would they come out as good if put in the microwave, so I'd say oven cooking these is definitely the way to go. Now, you can obviously make your own stuffed baked potatoes for far cheaper then what Omaha charges for these alone, but as long as you get a good deal on the Omaha website, these simply make a great addition to any Omaha steaks order. As delicious are they are though, I wouldn't order a box of JUST these off the site due to the added shipping costs. But like I said, as long as they're part of a nicely priced packaged deal, I'll definitely take them. Actually, I probably wouldn't order any packaged deal in the future from Omaha that didn't include these. A big plus, at least for me, is if you check the ingredients list on these, there's no partially hydrogenated oils, so there's no traces of trans fats, which is very rare with stuffed baked potatoes. Also no high fructose corn syrup, which is another rarity on a food product like this and is always a plus. If you make your own or buy them frozen from your grocery store for example, chances are, the butter used, sour cream, etc. will be full of chemicals, trans fats & high fructose corn syrup. These, not so much. So there is a definite degree of quality with Omahas stuffed baked potatoes. Each potato does have 8 grams of saturated fat, which is 42% the DRV, but that's obviously to be expected with anything that contains bacon, cheese and sour cream. I was also expecting there to be no fiber, but it turns out there's 3grams of fiber per baked potato half. Another plus. Overall, the stuffed baked potato was very tasty and actually relatively healthy, being made with quality ingredients.","I was excited to get this for my birthday, and I had never seen anything so beautiful.

Obviously Azaleas are outdoor plants, but our winters can get cold, even down south, so I bought a grow-light from Amazon.com, and I'm going to try to get this Azalea through the winter indoors.  In the spring, I can set it out under the arbor in the backyard.

It came well packaged, hardly any dirt or leaves had fallen into the box, and the soil was still damp.  I very gently freed it from the supporting cardboard by cutting the side out of the box.  Just a few minutes of snipping random yellow leaves (only half a dozen or so), and it looks happy underneath the grow-light.  I placed a pretty rock and a little mudman statue underneath the ""tree"".

vanilla | grocery | store | teeny | bottle | bake | time | quality | difference | bit | way | taste | extract | overpower | hint | flavor | oz | stuff | product,"WONDERFUL vanilla! We have been using the standard grocery store teeny bottle for years, and as we started baking more, figured it was time to invest in some quality vanilla. The difference is noticeable (to us at least) and as always, a tiny bit goes a long way. Rich, full, natural taste. It is an extract, but is not meant to be overpowering or very strong, more to add a hint of quality flavor. (basically - something strong does not mean it's good)

For 4 oz, a little over $10 is really about the same as the equivalent amount of the lesser stuff! This bottle is nice too and looks fancier :)

This tea combines the lovely sweetness of coconut with the dark rich quality of the chai.  The aroma is a treat as well.  Everyone I have made this for LOVES this tea.  When I brew this tea, I am able to use one tea bag for 2-3 cups of hot water and it still is flavorable.  I drink it with a small amount of cream and one artificial sweetner, but many of my friends like it without any sweetner at all.

It works, sort of, but it took so much of the product to get a decent color that my chocolate was too soft to set in the molds. I made three separate attempts just to make sure I hadn't overheated my chocolate or something.

Perhaps this product is better suited for candy melts and at that point, you might as well buy the pre-colored variety rather than having to dye them yourself. I did end up using some of this in a buttercream frosting when I ran out of my normal gel color and it seemed ok for that too.","I was excited to try this candy flavor, and I couldn't pass it up.

I enjoy preparing my own fruit shakes especially during the summer season. I am lucky because I have several relatives in the US which sends over a couple of the foods that they eat there, one of which is Power Bar Fruit Smoothie. They may have remembered me while they were enjoying this during their regular gym work-out. Thanks everyone!

Anyway, its time for me to place my verdict. The taste is absolutely yummy. I can eat a dozen of these while watching my favorite television show but in terms of its energy boosting effects, I have to rethink again. It must be due to the sugar included in its ingredients but I did not feel any boosting effect at all. Unlike what my Gene Eden Vir 101 supplements does for me. I am one of the few fortunate ones who is suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I sleep long hours yet feel tired and eat more yet feel hungry. It's a complicated condition but with my Gene Eden Vir 101 I manage to perform my daily tasks with ease. I could feel it effectively suppressing the growth of chronic viruses in my body thus giving me the added push to go on with may daily activities.

Nevertheless, I took into consideration the taste and the price offered by the manufacturers and will still consider it a very great tasting snack. But for athletes, maybe they can find other power products that can stand true to its claim.","I have a tendency to overdo it and find it difficult to get a good tasting snack. I especially like this one because it's so yummy and fills the stomach with nutrients. The summer season is nice, too."

The winds keep howling, the temps keep dropping and the snow is pounding us like we owe the clouds money. Every day I'm bundling up and shoveling four feet of something -- snow, ice, stranded hybrids, Kennedys -- and I'm done with it. I just wanted to find some way to warm up.

Also, to feel my toes again and have my [...] crawl back out of my rib cage. But I settled for trying to warm up.

I've always heard that if you warm up on the inside, then the outside will follow. So I bought this bottle of El Yucateco and saved it for the next inevitable snowstorm. When I was done shoveling and still shivering, I opened it up and slammed it down the hatch -- all eight ounces.

First, a few words about the taste: El Yucateco red has a nice tangy element, lingering through the forward habanero kick and beyond. The additional spices play well with the primary pepper, adding a savory depth that's more than just pure heat or capsaicin jolt. The tomato base and hearty thick texture promise a richness and complexity of flavor that is delivered quite nicely to the palate.

And now, a few words about the unrelenting napalm burn that traveled around my mouth, down my gullet and -- over the next twelve hours or so -- into, through, and out my intestines, scorching and defiling every square millimeter of delicate insides that it touched: [...]

Overall, I'd say this would make a very nice complement to a variety of Mexican or South American dishes, as well as grilled meats, starchy vegetables or as an extra kick to, say, garlicky green veggie side dishes.

So 'use in moderation' is the take-home message, I suppose.",I was excited to get this for because it's a winter wonderland.

mayonnaise | having | lot | recipe | flavor | mouth | fine | tipe | squirt | bottle | food | topping | replacement | meat | sandwich | tangy | creaminess,"I've wanted to try Kewpie ""Japanese"" mayonnaise for a while, having read about it on a lot of recipe sites. People speak so highly of it that I was really curious, but I couldn't find it anywhere locally.

The flavor is not what I expected, it is much eggier and tangier than regular Hellman's mayonnaise. Th flavor is somehow also lighter, and doesn't linger as much in your mouth. It is much less oily.

I love the fine-tipe squirt bottle, especially for Japanese food. It makes it easier to ""frost"" food as a topping. I don't know that I would call it a replacement for regular American mayonnaise, and I'm not particularly fond of it with meat, like on a sandwich. But it gives a great tangy creaminess to veggies, sushi, omelets, and sauces.","I recently had a lot of fun with thismayonnaise, thanks to the incredible recipe.

My father-in-law was such a grand soul. Highly educated, well read, artistic, Loved classical as well as contemporary music. Recited poetry from memory at the breakfast table. He did not tolerate cooking very well, preferring to load the table with sumptuous feasts purchased from the deli or local bakeries. BUT! Every Thanksgiving and Christmas he soaked a bag of gigantic Lima beans. Then he painstakingly cooked and stirred and spiced and annotated a huge cast iron pot of those limas. When the concoction was mysteriously perfect, this gargantuan pot was shakily hoisted into the oven to bake for what seems hours. ""Get outta the way!"" he would yell, ""I gotta get this thing in the oven!"" My first Christmas at his house, I mistakenly wondered why there was such a reverence for this cooking endeavor with a bunch of dried Lima beans. The pot of limas took preference in the oven to all other dishes. Even the turkey AND THE HAM!!! Oh. my . Word.

Well, the limas turned out to be barbecued. And they were to die for. Absolutely totally unbelievable flavors and textures. The whole house smelled divine when they were cooking. They tasted slightly different every year. Always better as each year passed. It could also have been that with each passing year, I grew to love my father-in-law more and more and more.

But, there was no recipe, so when my beloved father-in-law passed away suddenly one Easter, when the winter holidays rolled around that year, we recognized another loss in a tradition that was woven into our family in the holidays. There would be no feasting on barbecued beans. No wrapped dishes of it for the long ride home. No scrawled recipe to cherish.

So, we were determined to recreate the recipe. We found giant limas at the local store. Back in the dark corner in a dusty plastic bag. We soaked and soaked, but no amount of ministering to them turned them into the plump, melt in your mouth limas we craved. Finally, after several years of searching, I finally ran across these limas on Amazon. And they are perfect. Creamy. Hold their shape, but are tender when cooked. Delectable flavor. Eureka!

So, every holiday dinner, we tweak a recipe we developed. A bit more tomato sauce here. A splash more cider vinegar there. Brown sugar, spices, a dollop of love. Our recipe keeps getting better every year. Another year to ring in the holidays by clanging the cast iron lid on our cast iron pot and yell ""get outta the way! I gotta get this thing in the oven!""

So, here we are again! Thanksgiving is next week and I am ordering my Lima beans for the holidays! These are the best limas. Whether barbecued, or splashed with cream or swimming in butter. We haven't found a Lima bean as tasty in all the years we searched for them. We love them and they help us to remember a special person whom we loved fiercely!","I was really sad when I got this cookbook, but I still bought it. It's all good, huh? I'm still amazed at how well this cookbook actually holds up to the standards of the classical music, but this is"

It has a wholesome, nutty taste. I eat it almost every day for breakfast, since I can make it quickly and easily at work. I just pour some of this hot cereal and water in my bowl without actually measuring but still trying to following the proportions in the label (1:3), and then I microwave it for 3 minutes.

We were hot, sweaty, and more than a little worn out from having hoofed all over the historic district. It would take more than a few Dunkin Donuts to revive our exausted, jaded spirits and a whole lot more than a Krispee Kream to skewer our skepticism.

The pastries needed to be fresh, hot, and Paris-pretty to impress us. The coffee had to be perfectly percolated to perk us up.

What we had that morning (several plates of steaming, sinfully-sweet, precisely-powdered beignets) were tiny pillows of pastry perfection. The beignets were so good, we made several more early morning trips to Cafe du Monde during our stay in New Orleans. The coffee was utterly addictive, strong, lovely, full-bodied, with a rich aroma that could be detected long before we entered the shop.

Once home, I experienced a serious post-perfect-beignet let-down. Krispee Kream no longer cut it. Starbucks was sadly unsatisfying.

I was thrilled when I discovered I could buy Cafe du Monde's beignet mix and coffeee online. I ordered several boxes and cans, stocked up on a truck-load of powdered sugar, and anxiously waited by my mailbox. When the much-coveted beignet mix was finally delivered, I wasted no time in firing up the oil and brewing a pot of coffee.

I was very pleased with the beignet mix and the chicory coffee. The directions were easy to follow (just add water) and the amount of mix in the box was generous for the price. Once properlly prepared, the beignets were just as delicious as those served at Cafe du Monde (of course, you do have that tiresome clean-up when you make them at home that you don't have when you go to the cafe in New Orleans, but all truly great things come with a price).

The Scorpion Pepper sauce is basically just pureed peppers - and this stuff is simply incredible.  There are some seeds, so it won't flow though your favorite Sriracha bottle (I tried) - and it's about a zillion times hotter than Sriracha - but the flavor is absolutely sublime.  I go through about a bottle a week now, budget allowing.

If you can hang with the *seriously* hot stuff, but still appreciate a superior pepper flavor that isn't just ""blind heat"" - then this is the one for you.  It's got an amazing flavor, which (unfortunately) not a lot of people can appreciate because of the nuclear heat levels.","I like that this stuff has been packaged primarily for personal use.

I'm sorry to have to say this but Celestial Seasonings Chai tea is better than Tazo's. Normally I get a chai tea at Starbucks but lately I've been making a lot of tea at home. Now that the weather is cooler I'm trying out lots of teas. This chai tea is in little pillow bags so there is not waste. Since there are no strings, tags, staples or wrappers the company claims that they save more than 3.5 million pounds of waste from being put into landfills. This is really something. Anyway, this tea is made with black tea, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, cardamom, nutmeg, black pepper and star anise. It also contains some chicory and vanilla. Now I have to say I've been enjoying this tea but didn't realize its full potential until I drank it while eating a piece of banana bread. The flavors were perfect together. I'd recommend you really stock up on this tea because it is so delicous.

The labels I can read say ""CTF Brand"" with a picture of three stag's heads, if that helps.  The bottle I received is different from the image portrayed on the webpage so the product may not be the Gold Plum brand.  That said, the ingredients are stated as ""water, glutinous rice, salt"", with ""no additives"" which from another review, is what Chinkiang Vinegar is supposed to be...nothing fancy.  It passes my taste test anyway.  The vinegar I received is full-bodied and complex.  As some of the Asian cookbooks state, the taste is somewhat like Balsamic vinegar, which is a substitute for Chinkiang vinegar in many recipes, but I would add that ""somewhat like"" only applies to the cheap Balsamic vinegar sold in most grocery stores.  If you have ever had the truly wonderful, aged Aceto Balsamico di Modena, that costs as much or more than an 18 y/o bottle of single malt scotch (several varieties of which are sold on Amazon, by the way), there is really no comparison.

One of the other reviews stated that the bottle came in an ""unsanitary condition"", meaning that the bottle had leaked.  I would have to agree with that.  The bottle cap is apparently not air tight, allowing it to leak during shipping.  The bottle I received had leaked into the plastic bags inside the cardboard box, and the entire outside of the bottle was saturated, as were several of the plastic bags the bottle had been placed in.  The bottle appears to have only leaked a couple of fluid ounces, but this is pungent stuff, requiring that the shipping box and interior packaging be immediately banished to the outside trash and the bottle rinsed off and towel dried...I just hope that this vinegar is also good for the skin and hands!  :)",I am so disappointed that Avon discontinued this product because this is a great example of a successful scotch bottle.

Price I Paid: >$4/1 box(Free shipping due to amazon add-on)

Caff-O-Meter: 30mg according to website

Ingredients:
Black Tea, Cinnamon, Ginger, Roasted Chicory, Natural Pumpkin Flavor With Other Natural Flavors (Soy Lecithin), Luo Han Guo, Cloves, Nutmeg, Natural Sweetener (Stevia Extract) and Pumpkin.

This is the first time I have ever heard of Luo Han Guo, it is another (low/no cal) sweetener that appears to have been in use in the Asian province for years (what else are they hiding from us!). I would recommend taking some time to research it if you're interested, it makes many claims of benefits, but I am not informed enough to say whether or not they are true. Either way the use of this ingredient would not sway my purchase one way or the other unless the alternative was extremely high in g of sugar or made with the sweeteners known to cause issues.

-Smell(5) - Amazing smell! This is my favorite smelling tea thus far, the reminiscent of fall is definitely in there, closely reminds me of Sweet potatoes when cooked and prepared but stronger.

-Taste
+*Unsweetened:
*I prefer my teas Iced and 1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I (usually)add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average. However the sweetness in this stands out on its own as it contains sweetener extract therefore I am not going to give it the typical .5 compensation.
  Hot (5) - I have never come across a tea with such a naturally sweet flavor to it (likely attributed to the 2 natural sweeteners). I would be happy just drinking this hot with no sweetener (Iced is my preferred tea). Vanilla is the flavor that is standing out to me the most which is odd because its not listed, unless its under one of the natural flavors.
  Iced (4.5) - slightly thinner taste, this is likely attributed to the melting of the ice when I poured it over. The flavor is still sweet and taste is good I could easily drink this with no sweetener.

+Sweetened
  Hot (4)- Adding the sweetener (1 pkg of truvia) almost makes it to sweet for me but the flavor is still there and it is still good. It definitely makes the artificial sweetener stand out.
  Iced (5) - WOW! Perfect! Gets me right in the mood for fall, so far this is the best tea I have ever had (flavored at least)

-2nd Steep - (4) it weakens a little bit on the flavor but it still makes a great cup of tea, I didn't have try a 3rd steep but I would assume you could stretch it out to 3 maybe more. I did not deduct from this however because for a 2nd steep to still have as much flavor as it did is impressive

Summary - A solid 5 star tea, This tea is possibly the best tea I have ever had, I would precaution you that I do like my items on the sweeter side, and this had the sweetness naturally (read above on Luo Han Guo). Some of you may find this too sweet or ""fake"" sweet, it appears the sweeteners are natural though from my limited research.

If you must have some pumpkin tea now, here is a decent method to get you by (don't expect a miracle of flavor). Pumpkin pie spice (I prefer 1 tsp per 16 oz water) ""steep"" it for 5 minutes hot water then add your preferred tea for a normal steep time. Strain/Sweeten to preference. I use plain lipton loose leaf for now but I can't wait to try this with plain rooibos when I get it.

 I have many other teas for fall to try, so keep checking back. To get a better idea of whether or not we have similar tastes in teas check out my profile (I used to actually hate tea). And yes, I may have too much time on my hands.",I was a bit skeptical about the cost-effectiveness of this sweetener. Apparently they are all pretty similar. I was actually using it when I was 18 and didn't realize that the sweetener was actually pretty much

I find this brand by Spectrum essential is a very good one. It is organic which is what I am looking for. I take this mainly for constipation but also for the omega 3's in plant form.

When using this flax seed I find I stay regular. If you are having trouble with constipation this is a very good and natural way to remedy it. I add it to any food I am eating cooked or raw. I add it to salads and into smoothies as well. Two tablespoons a day is the amount that I use.

You can also add this to pastry recipes before baking like cakes, cookies, muffins, breads, you name it. It will also replace eggs in a recipe. You can google 'flaxseed, egg replacement' to find the correct ratio for your recipe or use mine. For each egg, combine 1 tablespoon of ground flax seed (measure after grinding) with 3 tablespoons of water. Stir well, and place in the fridge to set for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, the result should be a sticky egg-like substitute and it's ready to go!

But, I didn't want to give up my morning coffee/cafeine entirely.

I bought this from Amazon because I have not been able to find Chicory in any local grocery or specialty food stores.

I did not expecting that it would taste nearly as good as my freshly ground coffee.  I can honestly say that it is not bad at all, and a little goes a very long way!  I am finding that I only need to use a couple of tablespoons per 12 cup pot of coffee.

The reason? Japanese mayo is different. And it tastes better.

Before that, I was only familiar with standard American supermarket varieties like Hellman's and Kraft, and the idea of putting them on things like leaf salads and fries wasn't particularly appealing.

Kewpie, though the ingredients are similar, has a pronounced tanginess that balances the rich creamy texture, making it ideal as a mainline topping for a wide variety of foods. They go great on fries (Belgian style), leaf salads, and grilled meats. Japanese people put mayo on a lot of things, including okonomiyaki, takoyaki, yakitori, even pizza.

There is something decidedly fun about the squirt nozzle. It is much more convenient than American jar mayos that you have to scoop out and then plop onto the food in a big glob. The bottle itself is shaped like a pastry bag, with an opening about the diameter of a strand of cooked spaghetti. This allows you to squirt mayo with precision over your food, letting you control its distribution as well as design. Food I had in Japan often came with cross-hatched mayo patterns, like the pattern you see on the bag. If you remove the cap, the inner opening is star shaped, allowing for more decorating fun if you have kids.

It is far superior to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kraft-Mayo-Real-Mayonnaise-18-Ounce-Easy-Squeeze-Bottles/dp/B001EQ5EAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kraft Mayo Real Mayonnaise, 18-Ounce Easy Squeeze Bottles</a>, which come in an overly-rigid bottle with a horizontal slot that easily introduces air into the bottle as it re-inflates for the next squeeze, causing frequent splatter. Mayo also clings to the bottle's side and I have to give it a good hard jerk to get enough dislodged for another squeeze. Kewpie doesn't have this problem. It is soft and pliable like a toothpaste tube. Splattering is never an issue and the free-flowing consistency of the mayo formulation makes getting it all out quite easy. The bottle is also transparent and devoid of any stickers and labels, making it easy to see how much is left, and its tapered design channels the mayo into the opening.

Nutrition values are similar to American mayo. 100 calories per tablespoon (90 from fat), 20mg cholesterol, 100mg sodium. It does not contain any preservatives or artificial additives besides MSG. Kewpie is made in Japan, not in US subsidiary factories, so this is a true taste of a Japanese favorite. Give it a try and see why this is loved by so many people in Japan and Japanese food lovers the world over.","I like Mayonnaise because it's so delicious. I have respect for all the condiments and I appreciate their splurge. I also like the fact that it has a large amount of water, but some mayo"

I'm glad I did.

These two bite crumbly cake/cookies are delicious. The butter and pecan flavors are subtle - don't expect shortcake sweetness. They accompany both tea and coffee perfectly. The only problem I have with them is that they are very crumbly. I was breaking off a piece for my 18 month old grand daughter and the thing just exploded all over the place. She loved it though. So did the dogs. The wife has eaten about half of these already in a couple of days.

My parents loved it, and so did my British grandfather.  But it's hard to get here, so I've tried other pickles that call themselves ""chow chow"" and boy have I been disappointed.  They range from bland to a peculiar metallic sweetness that makes me want to yak.  I've never encountered anything quite like the C&B mustard pickle, and I'm just grateful that I can order it online.

This is perfect with cheese, or on a roast beef sandwich.  I like it with fried fish, or sometimes just on a cracker.  It's got a fantastic bite to it, and the ingredients - gherkins, onions, cauliflower - are nice and crispy...  And now I'm craving this stuff.

It's an ""extract"" sauce, it says it in the ingredients.  Which means the Capsaicin (the ""Hot"" compound) has been refined over and over again to produce the extreme heat.  It might be considered cheating, and I'm thinking this is probably what caused it to be kicked out of the National Fiery foods Contest.  The 1 problem here is that if your looking for flavor, you cant get enough of it because you can only use a little portion.  It's great to spice up weaker sauces.  Use it as an additive.

I actually prefer this same company's red cabbage, but only by a narrow margain.  This regular saurkraut is nicely sour, but not bitter.  It has a good overall flavor and texture to it, which can actually vary in saurkraut despite the general simplicy of the ingredients.

As someone who grew up eating saurkraut, its a treat to be able to buy this German brand and get something as close to homemade-tasting as you can purchase at the store.  It works well cold or warm, though most people tend to prefer it heated up.  You can also do what my grandmother used to do and saute porkchops and then simmer the cooked chops in the saurkraut before serving.

Works well as a side to most beef or pork dishes and, obviously can be spooned onto hot dogs or be served with sausages.  Go on, try some of this at your next BBQ!  Sure, you can buy cheaper saurkraut--or go to the trouble of making your own--but I think this version is well worth the price.",I stopped eating at Whole Foods and this is the only store that I have found that doesn't have any artificial dyes.

I make red curry dishes frequently and always used Thai Kitchen brand. But the teeny jars were not to my liking and I wasn't crazy about their green curry. The Mae Ploy red is super, but it was the green that's our new favorite.

I used it for the first time last week when I was preparing dishes for a private-chef client who's on a low, low carb diet for his recently diagnosed diabetes 2 and wanted to make him something punchy and flavorful. Not only did he love the dish, but he gave some to his mother-in-law (who's also diabetic) and she loved it, too. My husband cruised by the kitchen when I was cooking, intrigued by the delicious aromas and was disappointed that it was for Bruce and not for us. So over the weekend, I made green curry halibut and shrimp ""burgers,"" and they were such a success I'm making the same thing for Bruce's wife who's a pescatarian; the first dish featured chicken thighs..

I appreciate that Mae Ploy uses all real ingredients in their curry paste and the generous amount in the package means I don't have to go through lots of little jars. The heat level is perfect. It's hotter than the red, but not so spicy that you can't taste the other flavors in the dish. And if you can't tell that I'm all about the green curry right now, I'm using it again tonight in a pork and vegetable dish for company. We eat a paleo diet with lots of vegetables and with some coconut milk and few other additions to the curry paste plus some meat or seafood, I can make a healthy dish with huge flavors that's easy to prepare. Win, win, win.","I'm recommending this to anyone who wants to try this, especially if you're a teeny-something, I have no preference to any brand, as I'm ateeny-something who likes"

The flavor took a little while for me to get used to (like half of one box).  I generally drink it with and without artificial sweetener.  It does brew fast and it's nice that I don't have to heat up water to do so.  I'm not sure if I will order this flavor again or not.  If you're unsure, buy one individual box, try it, and if you like it then take advantage of this great pricing.",I purchased a small batch of this sweetener because it's one large box of sweetener water.

Most pizza seasonings we have bought tasted predominantly of oregano, but this one brings in layers of red pepper and Parmesan cheese without being too herbal.  We use it on pizza, but we also use it on spaghetti squash, grilled veggies, etc. We don't go crazy with it, a bottle lasts a long time. It's almost impossible to find locally now, so it's good to know that it's available here.","I recently had this amazing flavor at my local Domino's Pizza and this oregano pepper cheese bottle is the best I've ever had.

Even people unaccustomed to hot peppers will find this sauce ""medium hot"". True chili heads will find it very mild and more of a flavoring sauce than a hot sauce. Overall , it's a superb mild hot sauce with unparalleled flavor and I recommend it highly, unless you're seeking a truly hot hot sauce.","I really like Flavor by Nutmeg itself. It's a false moniker, but it does not seem to have any flavor. I do like that it has a subtle flavoring that is only slightly off."

fan | power | flavor | fruity | gum | reaction | consistency | degree | heat | taffy | plate | residue | inside | packaging | snack | g | sugar | serve | complaint | lack | fiber | fruit | smoothie | gram | illusion | package | manufacturing | process | livestock | feed | eat | bar | go | banana | orange | diet | workout | regime | relay | month | thing | stomach | recovery | candy | piece | run | minute | hour | core | gym | bag,"Me, I'm generally a big fan of PowerBars.  I don't look at them as ""power bars,"" but rather snacks that are agreeable, tasty, convenient, portable, and nutritious.

PowerBar's Fruit Smoothie (""Berry Blast"" flavor) is almost there, with a few big caveats.

I shared my PowerBar with 4 others, teens and adults.  All found the flavor better than expected.  One noted that it had a ""fruity gum"" flavor.  I had a similar reaction; it wasn't unpleasant.  All gave it a thumbs up for flavor.

The consistency was soft in 80 degree heat, like soft taffy.  When placed on a plate, it stuck to the plate and you had to literally peel it off.  There was a sticky residue left on your fingers and on the inside of the packaging.  This didn't make it the cleanest snack.

There were the 24g of sugar in one serving.  I thought this made it too sweet.

My biggest complaint was the lack of dietary fiber in this ""fruit smoothie"" (less than 1 gram; PowerBar's Harvest Bars have 5g).  The illusion is a package of real fruit.  Well, real fruit is full of soluble and insoluble fibers, essential nutrients.  The fiber tossed out in the manufacturing process here probably ended up as livestock feed, which is ironic when you think about it.

So for the consumers who have the illusion that they are 'eating"" a real fruit smoothie,  this bar is, obviously, something else.  Just remember, the PowerBar Fruit Smoothie isn't going to replace a banana and a Clementine orange in your diet.

FOLLOW-UP:  Two years later, with a much more strenuous workout regime (participated in Wasatch Back RAGNAR relay last month, 29 hours, 189 miles), the thing I like about this bar is that it is easy on the stomach as a recovery bar.  It's not a candy bar or, if you use it as one, it's an expensive piece.  I use it AFTER a run or strenuous workout (defined as a run of at least 5 miles, 8.5 minute miles or better, or a full hour of core workouts).  I like the tanginess.

 Just throw some in your gym bag.  You're good to go!","I am a diehard aficionado. This is a delicious snack that doesn't have much fiber. Think it would be great for an entire month of fast taffy, no sugar, no artificial dye"

A quick web search will turn up some fantastic ways to eat each cheese, ranging from marinated in olive oil and herbs (Idiazabal), to served with dried fruits and nuts (Mahon), diced and added to a tomato-based salad (Murcia al Vino), and even coated and fried (Manchego). I definitely recommend picking things that will highlight the flavors of each cheese rather than obscuring them, as these are truly delightful.",I was skeptical about ordering this in the U.S. because the condition was bad and the flavor was awful - I didn't like it - I had to try it again - it was beyond my wildest dreams.

Flavor: The predominant flavor is apples and cinnamon, with a persistent banana undertone, as well as tastes of raisin.  While not a rich banana flavor, it is recognizable, and none of the flavors seems off-tone-much more than can be said for similar products.  After looking at the ingredients below, I was very surprised that the banana power bar contains no cinnamon, and that the apple taste may be actually come from the grape and pear concentrates.  The ingredient list also reveals several grains (oat bran, rice bran, milled rice, brown rice flour), and the source of the banana flavor-banana powder.

Texture: After the initial touch bite into the dense, somewhat hard surface, the ingredients gradually present themselves as very chewy with a noticeable grainy texture.  Again, while initiates may need time to get used to this, it is not unpleasant, and the chewy quality gives the impression of substance (although there are only 3 grams of dietary fiber, as seen below).  I left one semi-open for a day or so, and found that the bar was easier to bite into, perhaps due to moisture absorption.

apple | cider | mix | experience | cranberry | hibiscus | land | choice | work | type | tea | ski | forest | munch | eggnog | purple | color | fragrance | infusion | steep | cinnamon | lemongrass | swirling | water | flavor | juice | sense,"Blend a little apple cider mix into your Tazo Passion Tea and see what happens. This creates a magical apple cider experience with hints of cranberry and hibiscus flowers gathered in an ancient land.

Snuggle Up Spiced Cider is a good choice because you can then spoon in the exact amount you desire, but packets of cider work equally well. This is the type of tea you would expect to enjoy after skiing in some distant forest where you are also munching on homemade brownies or eggnog cookies. Apple cider also works very well with the Gypsy Teas, especially the Lemon Jasmine.

The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance of Tazo Tea is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.

The original flavor is also slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice which is why it is extra delicious with a cider mix. Tazo Teas are a mysterious experience into which you can lose yourself with a sense of abandon. So far I've tried more flavors than I can count and have always been impressed.

If you dilute it in enough sauce, soup, chili or whatever you like hot sauce in you'll find that it has a really great taste that blends well with most dishes.  On the other hand if you just use it straight you'll probably be sorry.  For most people this would be considered an EXTREMELY hot sauce.

mayonnaise | condiment | rice | vinegar | spice | ajinomoto | hint | flavor | cooking | tounge | sweetness | bitterness | saltiness | make | difference | brand | bit | comfort | food | ketchup | taste | bottle | sit | fridge | know | time | tacoyaki,"I always used to hate mayonnaise, and couldn't imagine using it as a regular condiment.  Turns out I just hated American mayonnaise.

Japanese mayonnaise is made with rice vinegar and a spice called ajinomoto, which gives it a hint of the flavor called umami.  Umami is a special flavor, found mainly in Asian cooking, that can be detected by the human tounge outside the four basic tastes of sweetness, sourness, bitterness and saltiness.  Japanese mayonnaise is much better for cooking, especially for making salad dressings.  That hint of umami makes all the difference.

Kewpie brand is the most popular brand of Japanese mayonnaise, and so it is a bit of a comfort food like Heinz ketchup is to Americans.  Aside from tasting great, it is just nice to see the familiar bottle sitting in the fridge, knowing you can pull it out at any time and make your tacoyaki taste just that much better.","I like Mayonnaise: It's a condiment that I mix together with other dry rice vinegars, spices, and herbs. It really does smell like some ajinomoto spice. The spicy note is not great, but"

espresso | brand | flavor | cream | suger | coffee | thing | taste | americano | water | sugar | live | cuban | flavoring | lover | kind | drink | stuff,"First off, my usual espresso is the Starbucks brand.  I just like a strong flavor.  I want to HAVE to put some cream and suger in my coffee for it to be tolerable.  The first thing I noticed upon tasting PILON is that it's VERY strong yet VERY smooth.  I can't say that for the Starbucks brand espresso...actually at all.  I still put cream and suger in my americano's but I use less water, more espresso, and less sugar and cream.  That's because the flavor of this coffee is SO perfect.

Living in Chicago it's easy to find good espresso's, as intelligentsia and metropolis make excellent coffee for the larger brands here, but nothing really compares to the smooth cuban like flavoring of PILON.  Seriously try some if you're an espresso lover like me and would rather drink any kind of espresso drink than BLAH coffee.

This stuff is for REAL.","I am a big ESL fan, and this is the only brand that not only doesn't have any flavor, but you can get it in any other flavor. I like that it doesn't have any artificial dyes, so"

I bought the ficus from Brussel's Bonsai.  It being a tree, I wondered if the tree would make it to my mom in one piece.  Well, my mom called me today.  She just got the tree and she is thrilled beyond belief.  She said it arrived in absolutely perfect condition, as if someone had hand delivered it.  She still can't get over how it was possible.  She said it arrived in a huge box, but it was just a little tree and it looked perfect.  They had packed it so well.  I told her to send it back if there's anything wrong with it, but she said no, it is PERFECT.  Knowing my mom, she would have told me if it wasn't.

UPDATE:  I've had three trees sent as gifts to family and they have been an absolute hit!  Usually, I get a nice, polite thank you; but this time it is call after call from people who are at a loss for words, just like my mom.  Rarely does a present garner so much positive feedback.  Thank you, Amazon!",I am so disappointed that Avon discontinued this item because I have had such a poor condition that I could not find it elsewhere.

We were so sorry when we moved on southward and found ourselves outside Valentina territory.  When we came back up through Mexico several years later, we made a point of buying a couple of bottles of Valentina to bring back to the States with us...only to find that it had arrived in California grocery stores while we were away!

I see some complaints about too salty - I don't think it is salty and I do NOT use any salt when cooking nor do I eat any salty snacks so my taste buds would complain if this was too salty. Too hot? The way we make it, it's at most medium hot while the flavor is excellent (not diluted with coconut milk)...the hot sensation goes away very quickly...we love hot food - almost to a point of burning lips, eyes and nostrils hot but this is medium hot. Maybe it's less hot for us because we use a lot of veggies and eat it with white rice which always turns down the heat.","I have a lot of experience with bamboo and turkey breast.

However, if you are looking for a subtle fruity flavor then this is NOT it as this definitely has a robust fruity flavor. After having purchased and tried quite a few different flavored teas this is my second favorite.

The only one I like better than this one is the Celestial Seasonings Wild Berry Zinger which (to me) tastes exactly like a berry flavored unsweetened Kool-Aid so reminds me of my favorite childhood beverage.

I use it primarily for miso soup base, but also use it for ramen and udon noodle bases too.

I was always going between this and the sachets (Ajinomoto always!) because it is almost half the price as this jar. However, the jar keeps my dashi more fresh. Which makes it last longer.

I do between 1/3 and 1 tsp of dashi per 1 cup of water.  1/3 for my daughters, 1/2 for my wife, and 1 tsp for me. Then I use between 1 and 2 tbsp of miso paste. White for the kids, 1 tbsp white and 1 tbsp red for the wife, and 2 tbsp red for me.

I'll boil the dashi, add any veggies, remove from heat, then add the miso.

In any case, this dashi powder is 85-90% as good as Bonito flakes. It's totally worth the almost double the price of the sachets, the only time I'll buy the sachets is when I'm cooking for a group of friends, otherwise I find if I'm not finishing the whole sachet in a week to a week and a half, it starts to lose flavor and starts to taste like my fridge. With this jar, I can keep the jar for months with no issue.

Chef Paul really got it spot on when he made one seasoning blend for vegetables, meat, poultry and seafood. They pretty much have the same main ingredients but each one has that extra couple of ingredients that makes what ever your having taste amazing! Today I thought I would try the Vegatable blend with my pasta w/pesto and OMG, did it taste so so good! I am so happy with the blends I got.

I get all my lunches at work from a diet centre so sometimes I am stuck with very boring choices. I decided to keep Poultry, Seafood and Vegetables in the office with me at all times and and will keep the Meat Magic at home for my steaks :)

UPDATE:- I just used the Meat Magic over the weekend and WOW! I put a generous amount on every new york strip before grilling along with coconut oil and clarified butter (ghee) and oh man it tasted amazing! I have done close to a hundred steaks with different seasoning and marinade and this has got to be the best so far!

The american almond has a hard crunch to them.  These have a slight mealy taste initially but are moister in the middle.  They have a sweet taste to them to, never had that in an american almond.  If you want to avoid propylene oxide, definitely check these out.  edit: I originally gave this 4 stars but I keep getting almonds that I believe are rancid.  I'm  not sure what rancid tastes like  but it tastes like the almond is soaked in nutrasweet and then it changes to something very bitter and disgusting like vanilla extract, except these almonds taste much worse.  I had a few almonds that were off but I am now coming across almonds that fit my description of completely inedible.  These almonds are expensive, I would have expected a better quality especially when the label says they are good for another year.

couple | heat | rating | accord | pepper | world | bite | ghost | sauce | pain | lot | anybody | taste | smokier | color | cream | drop | extract | stuff | sale | additive | flavor | induce | edition | caution,"It seems like there is a new ""Hottest Pepper in the World"" every couple of years or so.  Not too long ago it was the Red Savina Habanero with a Scoville heat rating of 577,000 units.  Now it is the Naga Jolokia (also known as the Naga Morris, Nai Miris, Bih Jolokia and Bhut Jolokia, etc.) with a whopping 1,001,304  Scoville Heat Units according to the New Mexico State University Chile Pepper Institute. In February 2007, Guinness World Records certified the Bhut Jolokia (aka Naga Jolokia) as the hottest pepper in the world.  It is reportedly called the ""Ghost Pepper"" because after one bite of the pepper you ""give up the ghost"".

Now Dave's Gourmet has made a sauce from this serious pepper.  This is nothing to fool around with, it will cause pain, a lot of pain.  So why would anybody want a sauce that hot (other than for bravado)?  I for one like the taste.  It is a little smokier that Habanero.  I also use it in sauces where I want heat but not the red color of chili peppers, such as a cream based sauce.  Since it only takes a drop to give me the heat that I want it will hardly change the color of a white sauce.

My only reservations about it is that it contains hot pepper extract (which is what they call the stuff that they spray in the eyes of criminals).  I've seen hot pepper extract for sale as a commercial additive.  It's low on flavor but big on heat.  Was this added to give the sauce extra pain inducing heat while using fewer actual Jolokia peppers? I don't know but it makes you think.  Dave also has a special edition sauce that uses the Bhut Jolokia pepper and cost about four times more than this one does.  I like this sauce, but use with caution.","I have been using this for over 30 years and I was first attracted to it because it's so potently scented. And then, at some point, I got a warning: the pepper is no longer available and neither"

The most famous (rightly so) Spanish cheese, Manchego, is world class, and is really tough to beat.  Try some with some fig cake, or some quince paste, or drizzled with olive oil garnished with rosemary..  Serve with a fino sherry, manzanilla, or any number of red wines (depending on age of cheese), and you are guaranteed a winning combination..  Sliced, melted over a great burger, with a roasted red pepper and a hearty glass of earthy zinfandel = heavenly joy..  Cube and marinate in Spanish olive oil is also a treat... I have had no problems with iGourmet so far, so I can't comment on their customer service - all of my orders have been shipped quickly (1-3 business days), without issue.

I've been very patient--lately my cravings for hot anything have been very intense. I had an iron-clad stomach in my 20's and now, a few years later, I can still take a lot of heat that would leave a lot of men I know writhing on the floor. (My father and grandfather apparently gave me their 'hot food' genes!) That being said, this Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia Hot Sauce is very pleasant: it does have some heat, and it does have nice flavor. I have yet to try it 'straight' but, mixed into a spoonful or two of natural mayonnaise, it made the free-range chicken I roasted last night taste like hot wings! I started out with one drop, as advised by the bottle, but after I realized I certainly could take more heat than that, I added a nice dribble of the sauce to the mayonnaise concoction. Again, if I took it straight, maybe I'd feel more impressed with the 'heat' aspect of this nice sauce; yet as it is, I enjoyed it very much with my lunch but have honestly found certain large, raw garlic cloves much hotter. Those I can actually feel burning my belly. This hot sauce is just a nice punch of heat with a pleasant, spicy flavor. It smells wonderful when you take the cap off of the bottle!

UPDATE: A day later (11/25/14), I want to add that I did have some of the Jolokia Hot Sauce 'straight' on some more of my chicken last night. It made my lips tingle nicely, and I could tell it was in my belly--but was it truly HOT? I would say no, not for a person like me. For someone who does not like 'hot' things, probably they would think it is a very hot sauce. For me, the flavor reminded me a bit of Tabasco, but more engaging. I like the flavor, and I like the heat that the sauce does have. But is is a 'killer' sauce?

I have gotten off coffee many times and always gone back. I use a keurig machine for now, I've used french press systems, I've used standard coffee pots and instant.. it's all fine to me.

Well, I was walking through the Asian supermarket and found this on an isle. I had never seen it there before, or at all, for that matter. I first fell in love with the can. Our home is filled with vintage things so it called out to me. I immediately looked it up here and read the reviews and noticed it was in my hand for under $6 so I had to have it. It's 6:30 and everyone is sleeping except for the very sick dog who needs her morning breakfast prepared.. so I get up and do that and run Cafe Du Monde through the keurig.

look | treat | energy | lifestyle | bill | try | having | variety | fact | fruit | staple | diet | lag | berry | flavor | texture | getting | consistency | surprise | indulge | guilt | smoothie,"If you are looking for a flavorful treat to provide energy for a hectic lifestyle, the Berry Blast PowerBar Fruit Smoothie fits the bill.

I was hesitant initially to give this one a try, having tasted a variety of other energy bars over the past few years, some good, some dreadful. I liked the sounds of this one and the fact it's made from real fruit with no additional sweeteners or artificial colors and flavors. So I decided to try it. I am glad I did. While I don't see this becoming a regular staple in my daily diet, it is great for the occasional pick-me-up when I am lagging on energy.

It has a strong berry flavor which pleasantly surprised me. The texture takes some getting used to however. I wasn't quite sure what to expect so the taffy-like consistency was a surprise. Actually, that made it even better for me. I felt like I was indulging in a rare treat but without the guilt. I could see myself trying out the other flavors of fruit smoothie bars and see if they taste as good as this one did.

If you read the kidney formula canned foods, other than meat and vitamins, is flaxseed.

You have to chew two and a time, and that costs about $.20 per use at the listed price, not including shipping. The gum is boring and small and doesn't retain flavor or the texture I like, so I don't chew it very long when I use it. I don't like hard gums like Dentine or bubble gum; I usually use a soft sugar free gum like Extra.  It's cheap and comes in lots of flavors and stimulates saliva flow. I'm not a big chewer, I mostly suck on it, or let it sit in my mouth.  Biotene may be better in terms of mildness, but I love flavored gum, and am not willing to shell out so much to keep buying Biotene gum.

I dipped mini marshmallows in yellow chocolate to make little lego heads for a lego party. I needed something to write the faces with on the chocolate.

These are not expensive and you can buy them just about anywhere. It took me a very long time to write faces on the chocolate. The black marker was black and it worked but it worked slowly. I had to keep marking on a piece of paper in order to keep it working on the chocolate.

I haven't tried others so I can't direct you to any other types of food markers. But my guess is that there are others out there that do a better job. If you had a small job these would be fine. If you had to write a lot, it will not do a good job. It certainly won't live up to the picture on the cover of the box. This shows a pen making a pretty butterfly in one long swoopy line.

This ""English Breakfast"" style tea is quite satisfying and has a rich flavor that is quite delicious.

I'd like to say that their teas are best steeped for an extra 5-10 minutes to draw out all the delicious flavors. You can use a teapot or a coffee maker to make tea. Simply put the tea in a coffee filter or the tea bags in the coffee pot, then allow the boiling water to drip over the tea leaves.

The sensual blend of exotic spices, teas and herbs used in their teas include a mixture of the following: Black tea, green tea, hibiscus flowers, chamomile flowers, lemongrass, spearmint leaves, blackberry leaves, cinnamon, Rooibos, Gingerroot, rose hips, orange peel, rose petals, licorice root, safflowers, black pepper, lemon verbena leaves, cardamom, cloves, peppermint leaves, chicory, sarsaparilla root, lemon balm leaf, star anise and red poppy flowers.

This is a blend of black teas, but all their teas are worth trying. Passion and Chai are also favorites.

vanilla | taste | test | sugar | milk | cookie | glaze | icing | ice | note | chemical | edge | throat | dimension | penzey | way | combination | flavor | flower | pineapple | blend | mallow | pastel | candy | marshmallow | extra | race | neck | lot | fullness | contrast | simplicity | end | artificial,"Clear vanilla taste test of four top brands (mixed into basic white powdered sugar and milk ""sugar cookie glaze"" icing, which I use to ice cookies)

[1] Wilton - sweet one-note plain vanilla, with a faint chemical edge that tangs the back of my throat
[2] McCormick - thin one-note plain vanilla without any artificial extra dimensions or after taste, innocous. Like if the genuine McCormick vanilla had all but one dimension removed.
[3] Penzey's - I disliked - the best way I can describe it is a combination flavor with aspects of flower, artificial coconut-pineapple blend, and cheap mallow filled pastel coated easter candy.
[4] Watkins - tasted mostly of a strong filled out familiar vanilla with a second faint note of artificial toasted marshmallow - that artificial marshmallow extra is not something I want in anything I make

It came down to a VERY close race with McCormick and Watkins neck and neck, Watkins had a lot of points for its fullness in contrast to McCormick's thin plain simplicity, but in the end McCormick won because of what it did NOT have - no after taste chemical or otherwise, no non-vanilla flavor additions. It may be thin and simple, but it has nothing that takes away from the basic vanilla that it does have, and it doesn't even taste artificial. One pro, no cons.","I like that this vanilla taste is more than just a taste. I have a lot of similarities to other types of candy.

This particular blend does not make the cut. I want to like it but somehow the coconut does not really work in this tea.  The aroma is artificial coconut, and the flavor is a strange somewhat musty coconut flavor without noticable chai spice.  Drinkable but an eccentric blend--perhaps a diehard coconut lover would find this appealing.

Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.

So this tea tasted to me like regular black tea with a very, very strong bergamot-like flavor. I definitely did not care for it, although I love Earl Grey teas in general. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a more aromatic version of the Earl's traditional black tea scented with the essence of bergamot""; therein lies the problem---a little too perfumy and scented for me. On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as ""floral, lavender, fragrant, spicy, lemon"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""citrus, lavender, light smoke"".  You may like it; apparently the other reviewers so far do, but it is not for me at all.

Also, be careful of letting this tea brew too long accidently. Even a few minutes too long results in a bitter, bitter tea, reminiscent of orange pekoe with a strong perfume added. What a letdown! Even properly brewed, though, this tea cannot, in my opinion, warrant more than three stars.

The ingredients in Earl Grey are just black teas and bergamot essence. Note that Earl Grey does contain caffeine.

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

time | tea | peppermint | tin | taste | overpower | ginger,The first time I tried the Harney and Son's tea's was when I got some of the peppermint from Barnes and Noble while there.  I truly enjoyed it and when I finished the tin of tea I bought decided to try a few other varieties.  I have to say this one is a light smooth tea that provides a refreshing taste and is not overpowering.  It is good both hot and cold.  I would recommend it to other to try if they are peach and ginger fans,"I had a hard time with tea, but lately I've tried too many things. I'm still using it but next time I'll try it...maybe I'll try it............WOW..... my tea tastes...."

It's delicious and flavored with Splenda--which is a big plus for me since aspartame gives me migraines.  While on Atkins, I modified the mix by using half cream and half water instead of the recommended skimmed milk.  It fluffed up faster that way and had less carbs.  After I had gastric bypass surgery, I tried eating it using skim milk but found that the added whipped air in the mousse didn't sit well on my post-surgery stomach.  (Air/gas is not a gastric bypass patient's friend.)  It's been over three months now, so I'm willing to give it another try.

Not too sweet, crispy exterior with a fudgy interior -- really nice!

Like others, my shipment of six 14-oz canisters arrived with some breakage and crumbling.  So far, I've used 4 of the 6 cans, each containing 2 foil-wrapped sleeves (so I've opened 8 sleeves so far).  I've had 3 sleeves with NO breakage at all -- every one completely intact with just a tiny bit of crumbling on an end here and there.  The other 5 sleeves contained some broken cookies -- ranging from 20% to probably 60% of the contents.  Since I purchased these for my own use, this isn't a problem.  The broken ones taste as good as the unbroken ones. :-)  So far, I've had no sleeves with total disintegration of the contents.  But if you're looking for perfect presentation, bear in mind that you're probably going to have to deal with some breakage.

That said, I'll purchase these again.  The price is comparable to my local supermarket, and having it delivered is a convenience I'm willing to pay a bit extra for.

One of the manufacturer's suggested uses is removal of driveway oil stains.

For the last five years or so, I have always had a bottle of this sauce on hand specifically for those friends who swear nothing is ever too hot. The ultimate gratification comes from watching as they disregard any admonishments that direct consumption of any amount greater than a swab on a toothpick is too much. It is particularly helpful to quiet those who cannot refrain from talking over movies or provide undesired running commentary during sports events. Invariably, for next hour their only objective is to regain the ability to breathe normally. The only downside is this ploy only works once.

I like to mix about an 1/8 of a teaspoon with two ounces of regular hot sauce for buffalo wings, or add a dab to any taco sauce, however care is required because you can easily reach a point of diminishing returns as the unavoidable numbing of one's tastebuds makes enjoyment of the food impossible.","I like the 'clean' label, but the actual product is very similar.

Mae Ploy makes both of these tasks quite easy to accomplish. The very best curry is made from making one's own paste, however finding the time and perhaps even more difficult, the ingredients to do so does not compensate for the difference in taste. In my experience, Mae Ploy is an excellent green curry paste that tastes plenty fresh and will give you that same satisfaction that you get from a Thai restaurant.

A few things I've learned using their curry pastes over the years:

1) If you are cooking for people who are not used to Thai food, the proportions indicated in the directions on the container will be WAY TOO HOT for them. This is especially true with Green Curry and even more important if there will be children eating the meal. It's very easy to adjust the amount of paste used, and with practice you'll learn just how much is good for the experienced palate and how much is good for kids or newbies.

2) The packaging doesn't mention anything about how long the product keeps. The paste comes in a plastic container with a lid that can seal, but it's actually in a thick plastic bag inside that container. I used to cut open the bag and leave it in the container, but I've taken to just cutting a hole in the corner and using it like an icer would in a bakery. I feel like the double container might help it to keep a bit longer. Once the bag is opened, the product should be stored in the refrigerator. There is enough in the container to make several curry dishes.

3) Mae Ploy paste is fantastic, but choosing a bad coconut milk can degrade the quality of your dish or even ruin it altogether. Don't go with ""lite"" brands, and look for something more authentic if you can find it. I've found Chaokoh brand comes with a higher amount of cream which gives your curry a more consistent flavor. Chaokoh is the brand most often found in Asian markets and I've always figured that they would know best.

This product is incredibly easy to use and turns out a Green Curry that will make your friends think yours is good as a restaurant's. I don't believe there is a better paste on the market and when you factor in the price it's a no brainer. (FYI,If you live in an area where there are asian markets, you will do better buying it there as it will be even cheaper).","I was really sad when this product arrived in the store that I was eating it from but they did not have enough to satisfy my tastes. After several hours of cooking, I decided to try it for myself. The curry paste was amazing and I"

It is very minty and easily chewable.  You don't have to worry about breaking a tooth when you try to eat it.  The bar is dipped in peppermint on one side; the overall chocolate and peppermint is very reminiscent of a peppermint patty.  If I had not looked at the wrapper, I would be able to say this was meant to be a peppermint bar (try doing that with other protein/meal replacement/nutrition bars that claim to be peanut butter flavored or brownie flavored and they taste nothing like their inspiration.)  There is also no vitamin taste.

Overall, the bar is pretty filling and could hold you over between meals.  As it has less than 200 calories, it can be classified as a snack.  I like to eat one of these bars after dinner as a treat and also keep them in my office when I can't leave for lunch.

In sum, if you like chocolate and peppermint, try this bar.","I am so happy that I was able to buy this snack for myself. I don't have any other favorite flavor. I like the minty taste, but I do like all the other ones I've tried too, including the"

My parents are Thai-American, and we eat a lot of dishes with soup, noodles, and rice. We also make our own Thai sauces, using some dashes of Maggi seasoning. The times that I eat rice or even eggs, I always dash/splash this Maggi seasoning sauce on. This sauce is delicious and great and adds flavor to vegetable and meat dishes. A lot of the Thai people I know use this Maggi seasoning sauce. Plain soy sauce just doesn't compare to this Maggi seasoning sauce. In the past, each time I visited an Asian restaurant, plain old soy sauce just didn't cut the mustard for me. Once you have tried Maggi seasoning sauce, you get spoiled, and think that the typical soy sauce is bland and blah blah. The taste of Maggi seasoning sauce is special and unique. Maggi seasoning sauce is a staple in our household, and I couldn't imagine life without this Maggi seasoning sauce. If you want to have an idea of the kinds of dishes/meals you can create and make with this Maggi seasoning sauce, check out some recipes from one of Maggi's websites - type ""descubremaggi"" in the URL. Then click on recipes. Once the next page pops up, mark the box for Seasoning, and then mark the box for Search.

As one chews, it becomes rubbery; in the interest of this review I had to force myself to finish my one-third portion because it was so unpleasant.

But, I tell you what, here's the recipe for these cookies even better -- 2 sticks butter, 2 cups flour, 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 cup finely chopped pecans, 1 tsp vanilla extract, powdered sugar to roll in.  Those are the ingredients, the rest of the recipe is a not-so secret family recipe.

But, be forewarned, the tin was dented and about 20% of the cookies were in crumbs, which is to be expected from a recipe like this, if it's any good, which it is.

And of all the malted milk balls I've ever tried, WHOPPERS Malted Milk Balls are easily the worst quality, junk candies. For years they've had unacceptable numbers of duds; they've also been made of inferior ingredients, including hydrogenated oils and fats, which are horrible because trans-fats can't be properly digested by the human body. I'd love to see a candy company put out a decent brand of malted milk balls. Sadly, WHOPPERS are, in my view, not fit for human consumption. If you don't believe me, check out hydrogenated oils for yourself.

This spice blend originates in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico (according to my Mom) and is widely used in Mexican cooking. It was originally a Mayan condiment but has spread in use. It consists of Annatto seed along with a number of other spices. It is commonly also called Recado Rojo.

If you want to really augment the taste of the almonds, and lower the phytic acid content, it is very easy to roast them. I did it in this manner:

I have a small, square, Pyrex glass baking dish that fits perfectly into my toaster oven. I set the toaster oven for 350 degrees and turned to the Bake setting. I then spread a thin layer of nuts in the bottom of the ungreased baking dish. I place it in the toaster oven, and set a timer for 5 minutes. When it goes off, I remove the baking dish with a hot pad, shake the dish to resettle and redistribute the nuts, place the dish back in the toaster oven, and set a timer for another 5 minutes.

reason | medication | lettering | score | line | pill | frost | spray | chart | color | box | thing | paint | overspray | place | piece | parchment | paper | half | ease | get | dusting | crease | funnel | bottle | try | canvas | product | end | pro | use | price | quantity | lot,"I bought this for an odd reason: to identify medication.  I currently have 9 different medications that are all round shaped and white.  Some have lettering, some have a score line, some have absolutely nothing.  Since I divvy up my pills in one of those weekly boxes, it was becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish one pill from the other--so I thought of using this frosting spray.

I bought 9 colors of this Color Mist, and have made me a chart so I know which pill is which color.  It makes for a very festive pill box, but the important thing is that I can identify which pill is which.

I created a 'spray paint box' so as to not get the overspray all over the place, laid a piece of parchment paper (which I folded in half before placing in the box for ease of getting the pills back into their bottles), laid out the pills on the parchment, and LIGHTLY sprayed the pills.  All they need is a dusting of the color--enough to distinguish one from the other.  Dries practically instantly, and doesn't affect the pill at all.  Pick up the parchment, and with the crease as your 'funnel', slide the pills back in their bottle.  Repeat with any other pills you may be doing this with.

I have found that if you need more than the colors available, do one side in one color, turn the pills over, and do that side with another color.  Trying to ""blend"" the colors doesn't work....the 'canvas' is too small, the product has a wide spray, and in the end, they just look like some muddy color that you couldn't distinguish one from another.

It's a good product.....and on frosting, it's even prettier.  I know you can find this wherever Wilton products are sold--but they may not stock all the colors.

PRO: ease of use, price,
CON: quantity of spray/price--you don't get a lot in the small can.","I have been using Aerobics for overspray, and this is what I did. It takes a lot of time and the spray is perfect. I didn't feel the need to buy any other medication, and I didn"

It's more of a flat/bitterness issue than a heat issue. I was spoiled by the market-made version that I found in the fruteria, I guess! Trader Joes just came out with a TJ's version of this spice and it's great, the lime and sugar flavors are more prominent.","I like this style because it's not overpowering or bitter, as many people can't find it in a mainstream snack.

way | heat | pot | chili | batch | salsa | food | flavor | pepper | tangy | style | abuse | sauce | web | search | lot,"""Dave's Insanity Sauce"" is not to be taken casually or even as a way to add heat to individual servings, this is meant for larger dishes such as a whole pot of chili or a big batch of salsa since one or two drops will make a large amount of food VERY hot. That being said, this does have a really good flavor that adds a nice pepper tangy hit that complements most Mexican or South-Western dishes, but I wouldn't use it in Indian or Chinese style dishes.

There are several amusing and somewhat painful to watch videos of people abusing this sauce on various web sites and a quick search will provide you with a lot of hits.

It's not exactly the way I get paid for it. I have tried so many things that I have tried so far."

curry | paste | pinch | container | depend | flavor | tbsp | size | pint | ice | cream | bag | corner | rest | cabinet | stuff,"I LOVE this curry paste.  It beats Thai Kitchen hands down, I bought that recently in a pinch and I was SORELY disappointed.  This container is HUGE and will last you FOREVER.  Seriously, I have this in green, red, and yellow, and one container will last me several years.  It may be different for you depending on how often you make curry.  The ingredients for this paste are clean and are whole30 and paleo compliant.  The flavor is amazing, and I usually only need about 1 tbsp of this paste to deliver all of the robust flavor I need.  This container is about the size of a pint of ice cream, but not as tall.  But yes, it's large.  The paste comes in a sealed plastic bag inside of the plastic container.  I just cut a corner off the top and squeeze out what I need.  I store the rest folded up in the plastic container and keep it in my cabinet with my other spices.  I cannot stress enough how wonderful this stuff is and how nothing compares.","I like Curry paste. It's kind of crinkly, right? Well, at least I didn't think so. I had a pinch of this in mind, as most of the pastes out there have"

She is thrilled.

I would recommend this for anyone who likes giving plants that live-on for years.

seasoning | rice | rub | shelf | grill | tender | spice | burritos | zest | lime | flavor | hint | salt | pork | beef | chicken | fish | fruit | bottle | nutrition | shaker | sodium | version | lot,"We like this seasoning.  We add it to our cooked meals on vegetables, rice, into soups and stews.  We also use it on grilled ribs as a dry rub. We love to put the ribs on the top shelf of our infrared grill and slow roast them without any sauces until they are golden brown and tender.  This spice is one of the things that makes the ribs just taste perfect.  We also like to use it as a seasoning for different meats used in tacos, soft tacos and burritos.  It adds the zest of lime into the flavor and a very small hint of spice and salt.  It works great with pork, beef, chicken and fish along with vegetables and fruit.

I have included photos of the bottle, the ingredients and the nutrition data.  It comes in a shaker bottle.  It is made in Mexico.  There is even a low sodium version available.  This is a good spice and we like it a lot.","I like seasoning rice with a grain of rice. It's easy to throw on a grill, just fill it with some of the marinade herbs and spices.

curry | heat | heaping | table | spoon | silverware | measure | paste | size | milk | pound | meat | shrimp | batch | soy | marinade | stir | fry | color | add | mixture | flavor | time | sugar | restaurant,"Never cooked curry before.  This makes it so simple.  I just follow the directions.  You need to experiment with the amount you use for the amount of heat you want.  I use a heaping table spoon (silverware, not a measuring spoon) of the curry paste for one standard size can of coconut milk, and about a pound of meat or shrimp.  It's hot, but not crazy hot.  I tried 2 heaping tbl spoons the last batch, and it was way too hot for me.

I suggest using a simple soy marinade on your meats, and I give a partial stir fry to mine, to give it a little color, before adding it to my curry mixture. Gives the meat better flavor I think as the curry doesn't have time to penetrate it.  I use light coconut milk, so I let it reduce to thicken up before I turn off the heat.  Add sugar and to taste until you get it where you want it.

Just as good as the Thai restaurant I eat at!

I think I'll try the Panang next.","I recently had a huge amount of shrimp in one sitting, and I was all piled up with them. They were all pretty similar, except for the large spoon. I used this one when measuring my shrimp. It was so big and"

It got some publicity so do a search for ""hot sauce lead"" to read up. Aside from the lead, the use of artificial colors also bugged me. The study concludes that simple adjustments to the manufacturing process, such as washing the peppers, or not using salt from the earth, but rather the sea could remedy the problem altogether. If they're not even washing the peppers before processing them, then they are probably covered in pesticides as well.","Interestingly, I have used this for years and loved it.............

A couple of years ago, I bought a Whole Foods gift basket from Amazon, and it had the most delicious jar of mustard in it.  I never had a mustard ""wow"" me before, but that one did.  I finally tried sriracha sauce this year, and I really like it.  I was hoping to at least like this Kewpie Mayonnaise.  I did not.  It does have a definite egg taste to it... but it also had just the least bit of a sour or tangy tone to it, which was off-putting enough for me to finally discard the bottle after a few weeks.  I tried it on sandwiches and in different salads (green salads, chicken salad, etc).  I didn't find anything that tasted good when this was added to it.  Each time, I thought ""I wish I had used regular mayonnaise"".  However, the container is pretty cool. Very thin-feeling plastic bottle, and the product comes out well, spreads well.  I just thought it tasted kind of yucky.","I decided to purchase this for myself as part of a gift because I felt like a couple of bucks worth of food. They make wonderful gifts.

quality | vanilla | extract | market | alcohol | lot | regulation | require | rule | buy | money | home | bottle | category | disease | mind | advice | glycerin | oil,"Good quality however, just about every organic vanilla extract on the market has alcohol in it and a lot of alcohol because of an FDA regulation requiring 35% alcohol in vanilla extract (IMHO a useless stupid rule). I don't like alcohol. I find that buying the Grade A vanilla pods (which might take awhile if they come from Asia) allows me to make about five times the amount of extract for the same amount of money. My home-made extract is far stronger than even the best and without alcohol. I use a lot of vanilla. This bottle is small, and overpriced but it is better quality than the others in the same category.

Vanilla is anti-carcinogenic. Alcohol causes disease. Do you think the FDA has your best interests in mind? Abby's advice: get pods and make a glycerin or oil extract yourself.","Very high quality vanilla extract. On the market, there is a lot of alcohol in it but most importantly, it is very low quality.

power | blast | flavor | example | boost | salt | exercise | protein | bar | decision | workout | run | work | course | snack,"These power bars in that mixed berry blast flavor are tasty and delicious! True, I have to take a few minutes to chew them--they're not something I can eat very quickly, they're too chewy for that. Most importantly, but they are very  helpful to me when I exercise. For example, they are excellent for a power boost shortly before I exercise; and they help me replenish the salt I lose when I perspire both during and shortly after exercising.

Some will say that these bars really give you protein while others maintain that these bars don't have enough protein. They do have 6 grams of protein per bar so I guess it becomes an individual decision when it comes to just how much protein you want; you could have two bars before a workout or running if extra protein is what you want.

Overall, these bars are great. I love them! They are excellent for athletes and anyone serious about working out, but of course they can be enjoyed as a snack if you wish.","I have superpowers.

If it is heat pasteurized, the food is then tested to determine if pasteurization was successful. This test is a test for live enzymes. If there are live enzymes present, the pasteurization process failed and the food CAN NOT be labeled pasteurized!!!!

At 160 degrees ALL enzymes are dead!!!!

If the enzymes are dead, the food is no longer a RAW FOOD and no longer has the benefits of RAW FOOD!!!

Live enzymes are ONE of the main reasons why food is eaten RAW, because live enzymes are very beneficial to the body!!!

If a food has been pasteurized, the enzymes are dead and no matter how much the California almond industry tries to twist the definition of a RAW FOOD to deceive the public and put more $$$$ in their bank accounts, pasteurized almonds are no longer RAW and no longer have the benefits of a RAW food!!!

If they are chemically pasteurized and you eat them, you are putting toxic chemicals into your body. Toxic chemicals remain in your body forever and continue to build up in your body. Toxic Chemicals are a leading cause of cancer!! The more of them you eat, the more toxic chemicals build up in your body. The more toxic chemicals built up in your body, the more likely they will cause cancer!

Here is a link to three great articles on the subject of falsely labeled pasteurize almonds being labeled as raw: http://www.naturalnews.com/021781_almonds_California_pasteurized.html#
And
http://www.enn.com/agriculture/commentary/22282
and
http://www.dirtdoctor.com/Almonds-Raw-or-Pasteurized_vq1948.htm

The key word in the quote: ""raw almonds that have been pasteurized do not differ in any significant way from untreated raw almond"" is the word ""significantly"". Their definition of significantly I am sure is MUCH different than a consumers definition. Their definition is from the point of view of what is best and most economical for THEM, not consumers!!!!

The reason that pasteurized almonds came about was due that in 2003 & 2004, 29 people became ill from eating almonds bought at Costco because they were contaminated with salmonella. Because of unsanitary conditions in the processing plant that sold the almonds they became contaminated with salmonella. Rather than force all processing facilities to maintain proper handling, constant sanitation and clean and sanitary processing facilities, they chose to adopt mandatory pasteurization of almonds instead.

Here is a quote from the second link above to an article on almonds, pasteurization and salmonella: ""no scientific evidence exists to show that almonds are an inherently risky food. In fact, Salmonella contamination of almonds can only occur when livestock manure or fecal matter is inadvertently transferred to the nuts through contaminated water, soil, or transportation and handling equipment. Almonds may also be infected by poor employee sanitation either on the farm or in processing facilities.

While two outbreaks may bring bad publicity and economic losses to the almond industry, it does not prove that almonds are inherently unsafe. Is it justified to impose these onerous regulations on an entire industry, impacting all consumers, because of two relatively small outbreaks, one of which has been traced to Paramount Farms, a giant, industrial-scale farming operation raising 70,000 of acres of nut crops, that is by no means representative of the industry as a whole?""

Small farmers many times can not afford pasteurization equipment, so this helps reduce competition for the large almond growers by putting the small almond growers out of business. This is just another example of the morality, thinking and reasons behind much of what big business does and why they do it.

I hope this information helps

I used it every day and never left the jar opened, so it was not as if the mayo had sat around for a long time in the frig and gotten old.

At least it didn't make the coffee any worse, but those looking for a significant difference using this stuff, you will probably end up let down.",Difference between coffee and coffee tastes is great. I like the difference but it doesn't make sense to me. I don't like coffee tastes like most coffees I've tried. I do like that it
version | bar | flavor | mouth | crave | tamarind | way | hint | saltiness | saltwater | sugar | pulp | corn | syrup | salt | acid | ground | chili | sodium | benzoate | fan | bit | put | spice | level | spiciness | note | sensitivity | richness | point | feeling,"These are like a grown-up version of Fruit Roll-Ups, and I only wish I had found them sooner.  Each individual bar is roughly 1.25"" by 2.5"" but they are jam-packed with flavor!  The second that one is out of my mouth, I am already craving it again.  These Pulparindo are sweet and full of that lovely tamarind flavor, but are not cloyingly sweet the way many American candies are.  There is a hint of saltiness, as if they have been infused with saltwater (they aren't; they are made with sugar, tamarind pulp, corn syrup, iodized salt, citric acid, ground chili, and sodium benzoate).  I am a big fan of salt, so others may find it a bit salty (honestly, I would love them just as much without it), but it is subtle enough I don't think it is enough to be off-putting to anyone.  The spice level is also very low.  I like things a bit spicy, but cannot tolerate higher levels of spiciness, and this did not bother me at all.  The chili is really a subtle back note, so unless you have extreme sensitivity to spiciness, you will barely notice it.  It brings out the earthy, richness in the tamarind in a lovely way.  I may try the spicier version of this at some point, but I have a feeling I will return to these regularly.

Do not be turned off by the purported spiciness, as it is very mild.  I highly recommend them to everyone!!","I like this spiciness bar flavor; it's not sweet, it's sweet and tangerine. It's really delicious, and I'm sure you'll too. The bar is small, but has"

I keep them stocked in our pantry.  The blends are great, flavorful, and compliment a wide range of foods.  My favorites are the Barbeque and Salt Free Seasoning.  Alone or combined to create your own mix, these blends are awesome.  We love to use the Barbeque on steaks and ribs or mixed into baked beans.  The Fajita blend is great for making marinades or adding to ground beef for tacos.  The Salt Free and original Seasoning are great for anything and everything.  I will admit that I have yet to try the Salmon seasoning.  The others I have purchased previous and jumped at the chance to try this 5 pack.  You just can't beat the price.

We use it in EVERYTHING.  Frankly, it's one of our secret ingredients.  The brilliance of this is that it is NOT vinegary, so doesn't add acidity to your dish, but does add an underwarmth, not a KICK.  If you use too much, it might be too spicy for some, but I use it in almost everything to give it a warm feel on the tongue...let's call it a ""finish"" of warmth. People who aren't familiar with it, love the subtle change it can make.  Recently won over an American lady when we made a huge batch of cole slaw for a bbq event.  I said, let's just add a touch to a ""sample"" and see what you think.  She couldn't believe the lovely change...clearly did not make it spicy, but the difference is remarkable.  I put it in: homemade salad dressings, homemade mayo, every type of soup and stew, caramel sauce, salsa, guacamole, spaghetti sauce, ham glaze, grilled cheese, chowders, chinese, omelette fillings, cheese sauces, rib rubs,  etc.  My daughter wishes it came on a key chain like sriracha...and I had to give her a bottle to keep at her boyfriend's...as everything tastes better with it.

When I was really young, my mom used to brew up big batches of iced tea.  First, she would get the jugs ready, and then pour hot hibiscus tea into them, and add a lot of ice.  We'd set them out in the sun and the natural light in mid-day would make the tea naturally sweet, as it brewed.  Those were definitely good times.  What better past time in the summer, than to brew a nice pot of iced tea on a sunny afternoon?  Tazo Passion Tea doesn't fail to disappoint.  For starters, one of the main ingredients blended to make it so delightful is hibiscus (along with orange peel, rosehips, cinnamon, lemongrass, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, licorice and red poppy).  If you like your tea on the (slightly) tart side, I reccomend you drink this unsweetened and relish its wonderful, natural flavors.  However, if you prefer some sweetness in you life, add a teaspoon of honey or your favorite sweetener for a different flavor note altogether.  Doctors are now reccomending people drink five cups of tea daily, for improved health.  Make Tazo part of your regimen!  It's a great way to take care of your health, while making an excuse for a much-deserved tea break.","I like to use Tetrahea in my mom's kitchen when I get older, so she gets to keep it ice creamed up in the sun.

Luckily, I only had to purchase one tin so unlike many other teas on Amazon where the cost reflects 6 boxes, this time I took a chance and it did not pay off for me. I do wish this company and other companies would indicate whether the flavorings in their teas are natural or artificial. I have a feeling that if the flavoring in this tea is artificial that would negatively affect the flavor but I can't say that's the case because the tin doesn't make that clear.

This is the sweeter variety of black vinegar that is better suited for dipping (steamed buns, steamed dim sum dishes), rather than the cooking variety (which trends towards being more astringent, with stronger vinegar flavor), albeit it is completely suitable to cook with.

You can do many things with this, such as using in marinades, braises, stir fry, boosting flavors in soups, and part of dipping sauces/by itself.

A lot of people focus on the hard spices and thicker sauces when cooking, but overlook the importance and versatility of vinegars.  This is a must have for authentic Chinese cuisine.",I recently had this amazing experience at the Ritz-Carlton in Culver City with Vinegar fermentation. It is made of rice with barley and other non-fermented grains. This component is unique as well as the flavors are

I used this on decorated royal icing cookies and used the technique where you mix the luster dust with everclear and brush it on the hardened icing. In the little container, the color doesn't look very bright or shiny, but if you use this technique, you'll see super shiny results that look beautiful. If this was any shinier, you'd be able to see your reflection. Great stuff, would definetly recommend.","I'm a big fan of the Sonicare Cluster Dust icing technique. It works great with any flat iron or plastic container. The color is much better, too. I use it with the shinier reflection of the dust"

They DOUBLED THE PRICE SINCE I PURCHASE THESE on order date of Nov 12, 2013 and today is Nov 26, 2013..........  DAMN, unless this price goes back down, I will NOT purchase them again, and WOULD NOT recommend anyone else purchase them!!!
  When I bought them they were $4.88 a bag!!  I purchased them with item ""Hershey's Baking Pieces, Milk Chocolate Chips, 11.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)""  the milk chocolate chips were $11.88 (and today are the SAME price!!).  I previously purchased ""Milk Chocolate Gourmet Pecans 1 Lb (453g)"" by SweetGourmet, and they were just ""okay.""  I was NOT impressed by them, and since they are a food item, they don't qualify for a return, and I REALLY cannot return items, I am home-bound and don't have anyone to run errands for me.  I went ahead and ate them, as I say they were just ""okay,"" A LOT OF CHOCOLATE, and few pecan pieces...  NOT the big chunks of pecans that the picture implies.  I will NOT buy them again, nor would I recommend them.
  ANYWAY, I went ahead and used 1 and 1/2 bag of milk chocolate chips, melted them carefully in the microwave (avoiding scorching them), then added the 8 ounce bag of chopped pecans.  Spread them out on a foil layered cookie sheet, put them in the refrigerator at least 1/2 hour to let them set.  Then broke them into pieces and put the pieces into Ziploc bags to keep them fresh, and eat them a little at a time at room temperature.
  It costs about $5.00 A POUND, instead of the $12 a pound for the chocolate pecans with hardly any pecans!!  And I liked the taste of the Hershey's milk chocolate much more than the prepared Chocolate Pecans that I purchased!!!  These could be GREAT as a treat at a potluck >>>  just get some tiny petit four cups, spoon in the chocolate pecans, and become VERY, VERY POPULAR!!

Then I tried to roll  it out, it was so stiff I was using my whole body weight to roll it. My husband rolled it out with difficulty.

I am impressed with this gum because of its way of using natural enzyme protection to relieve dry mouth and protect your teeth from decay during cancer treatment.

Oh yes, it's true--the gum loses it mild mint flavor pretty quickly--after just about a minute! However, if you want to protect your mouth during chemo, it certainly couldn't hurt to at least chew this gum some of the time. It beats getting cavities. At 44 I still have no cavities and I'm not about to start now!

You do need to chew two pieces of this gum at the same time. One piece will be too small and you could accidentally swallow it, I suppose.

The two pieces of gum have a total of five calories, so don't be concerned about that. It is sweetened with xylitol.

Overall, this gum can save you from dry mouth and tooth decay during a course of cancer therapy such as chemo. It may work well if you need radiation therapy, too. It's not a fun type of bubble gum, (how I wish that it were) but it does what it sets out to do--protect your mouth from decay during a course of chemo treatment.

Ask your dentist if you have any questions.",I have had multiple surgeries on my gums that have left long scars and cavities. The dentist at the Mayo Clinic in Culver City gave me the courage to ask what I was doing and how could I get it all back?

It was always one of things in the cupboard that rarely made an appearance on the counter unless it was needed for some gingerbread baking recipe. Funny, it was baking that led me to try it in other applications. I was working on creating a cookie that didn't require much white sugar, and took a chance at using some of the contents from the dust covered jar of molasses (another popular brand). It tasted great, so much so that it became my ""secret ingredient"". One day not long after, I had a craving for molasses. Weird, right? I tried a spoonful, but didn't really care for the taste by itself. I then added it to my coffee and found that it lent an intriguing flavor. After all the NON gingerbread baking with my new found ingredient, I didn't have much molasses from the initial jar left. I don't think I ever saw what an empty jar of molasses looked like.. ha.  So when that was empty, I made purchase of this Plantation brand, which happened to be the only kind of molasses in the store I was in that time. It was less than $5 for 15 oz. I brought it home and tried a small spoonful. It just opened up my senses and something about it really appealed to me. It tasted real, like it was something I should be eating daily. I then added it to my coffee, and was amazed/delighted/stoked about how well it went with my coffee (which I drink very dark/bold, and now also primarily drink coffee alternatives--which I have reviewed); like it was made to go together: Coffee, Molasses and..Me!  (I told you upfront that I was excited over this stuff.) With this newly discovered affinity towards molasses, I had to research to see if there were any benefits to consumption. Well, indeed there is. There is no shortage of good information by placing these words into a search engine: ""blackstrap molasses benefits"", and what blackstrap molasses is versus molasses.
So how is this brand different than the others? It has a natural, lightly sweet taste. The flavor profile is coffee/caramel-like. Not tangy nor robust, like many others (which is probably best for baking and BBQ sauces). It has a deep dark flavor that is highly appealing. Closer in taste to buckwheat honey. Try drizzling it over high quality vanilla ice cream, and you will pick up on the caramel notes. My primary application is to coffee/coffee alternatives.  I have since tried (some offered on Amazon, in larger quantity) other brands of ""blackstrap molasses"". I assumed they would all have the dark flavor compared to regular molasses. Not necessarily true. Some taste too bright and tangy. Some are good, but not quite like this one. So if you haven't been consuming molasses and would like to start, just know that it might take some time and money finding one that is perfect for your taste preference. All the more I can say about this brand is that I have seen several bottles become empty these past few months. As a side, these nice glass bottles can be reused as cleaning/personal care product containers by using the spray mechanism from a plastic bottle. Just cut the straw part down some. Enjoy!",I recently had a craving for something with sugar. I decided to buy this because it seems to be the best smelling cookie I've ever found. It's not available to me anymore.

I bought this directly from Amazon and it was packed well for shipping.

specialty | cross | cheddar | quality | cheese | place | friend | go | work | sampler | try,"I am usually not overly impressed with these samplers of specialty cheeses, but I do run a cross one now and again that simply stand out. This is one of them. I fully admit to being almost addicted to good cheddar so perhaps this is part of it. The quality of this cheese, even after being shipped all over the place and from heaven knows where, is absolutely excellent. My sweet friend Brenda sent me this one and it is going to take some hard work to figure out how to top her on this one. Secret for you: I plan to purchase one or two of these myself soon horde it away, and simply not share! I do recommend you give this sampler a try...you will be absolutely delighted.",I have been using this for over 40 years and this is the only cross-bridging cheese I've found that doesn't make sense.

oil | condiment | way | heat | substitute | salt | soy | sauce | fish | count | sodium | intake | serving | teaspoon | rice | fat | mg | watch | thing | jar | serve | lot | flavor | profile | element | spice | meal | pun | trick | sir | frying,"Although many folks cook with this oil I use it as a condiment. I love the way the spicy heat builds and spreads, and the subtle and not-so-subtle flavors that you can taste. Also, it is salty enough to use as a substitute for salt the same way you would with soy sauce or a fish sauce.

A little goes a long way, and especially if you are counting calories, fat or sodium intake. A serving is about a teaspoon - more than enough to mix into rice or drizzle over other dishes - and it comes in at 90 calories. That same serving contains 9 grams of fat and 440mg of sodium. So, do use sparingly if you are watching any of those nutritional factors.

Another thing that I personally love is this is unfiltered. There are pieces of peppers and other ingredients that will suspend in the oil if you vigorously shake the jar before serving. Those add a lot to the flavor profile, which is predominately salty and piquant (and there is also a distinct element of umami).

If you love spicy sauces and oils and want to 'spice' up your meal (pun intended) this is an excellent infused oil that will do the trick. I wish I could elaborate on how it works for sir frying, but I do not use it that way. I can say that it is an excellent condiment.","I recently had this wonderful oil as part of a cooking condiment and this is my favorite. It's so delicious and deliciously flavored. I don't like the salty saltiness of soy sauce, but I do like"

I even gifted some to my daughter for making this bread. She is an amazing cook.
time | meal | head | habanero | edge | overpower | heat | depend | tolerance | crank | have | option | go | pain | flavor | way | spiciness | bonus | bottle | hand,"I love extremely hot sauces from time to time but for a normal meal where I don't want my head to explode, this is my go-to sauce.  It's loaded with habanero and is right on the edge of overpowering the meal with heat.  I like that because you can use more or less and, depending on your tolerance of heat, crank things up to 11 while still having the option of going easy on the pain.

The flavor is the best part.  It's really good, the same way that sriracha has a really good flavor and the spiciness is just a bonus.  I always have a bottle of this on hand.","I had a hard time eating this at lunchtime and this was the only one that wasn't overpowering like other types of cranky food processors.

foray | gel | coloring | cake | batter | bit | color | oven | taste | texture | difference | counter,"This was my first foray into gel food coloring. I use it to dye cookies, cake batter, and icings, which it works wonderfully for. You only need a tiny bit to get bold color (which doesn't fade in the oven) and it doesn't change the taste or texture of your baked goods. I would highly recommend this, especially if you've never used gel before. The difference is amazing. Be careful with it, though-- it's also quite good at coloring hands and counter tops!","I decided to use this for myay gel coloring.

way | meat | fat | grind | grinder | time | gun | ground | piece | have | flavor | eliminate | try | season | nonground | dry | surprise | grinding | damage | satisfaction | foodsaver | moisture | shelf | life,"I'm sure all of you have your own way of doing this. Myself, I prefer to get the leanest meat possible. Have used London broils, trimmed out all the tendons and fat and I do a double grind in my meat grinder. It's difficult to season the meat thoroughly and evenly, but the 2nd grind eliminates that for me. After the 1st grind, season the meat evenly, 1 lb at a time. Then run thru the grinder a 2nd time, which really mixes it up. Using the jerky gun, it spits out evenly the double ground meat and it dries very well.  I've never noticed one piece of meat having more flavor than another, thus eliminating under / over cures.  I hope this helps anyone trying for the 1st time.  Seasoning nonground strips of meat and drying is doable, but the meat will always be tough to chew and hard on ones teeth, perhaps even damaging is you pull too hard to tear off a piece to chew.  Being skeptic,  I used the jerky gun and much to my surprise the strips are very tender (thanks to the grinding) and safe for all ages and no damage to your teeth, false or real.  Once dried to your satisfaction, I bag mine in my foodsaver to keep out moisture and extend it's shelf life.","I have been using this for years, and I was first introduced to it in Madera in the early 90's and for some years had them ship me the meat to the grinder.

espresso | drip | coffee | mix | taste | favorite | convenience | money | time | expiration | handful | vacuum | happen | wrapper,"Both the 100% Arabica and the Espressione Espresso are excellent for espresso drinks. Traditionally espresso, unlike good drip coffee, is made with a mix of Arabica and Robusta coffees. The taste differences are noticeable, but I don't have a strong favorite. I use the pods for convenience, although I also roast my own green beans for espresso as well.

If you look at the negative reviews, they're mostly on the ""best before"" dates being passed. While I would also be upset to spend money and get ""expired"" pods, I should point out that the pods are good for quite some time after their nominal expiration dates. I just found a handful of these Espressione Classic pods with 2002 (this is late 2009 now) dates and they made acceptable, though not spectacular espresso. Basically they're vacuum packed and not much is happening inside the wrapper.","I purchased this for personal use. No other drip coffee or coffee. I like the convenience of drip coffee, but most espresso drip coffees are made of plastic (within the espresso) drip coffee."

Have tried other brands when I could not find this in the store and regret it. It is a mild flavor and is good to use when making jerky or sticks. All NESCO flavors are great, as family likes the Teriyaki flavor. For best results would recommend letting set overnight after mixing, covering with plastic wrap in refrigerator. Would also recommend using beef at least 85% or less. It will come out dry, if you don't. Using the NESCO dehydrator, it runs around 165 degrees. Rotate the trays as the lower trays dry faster, and turn the jerky as it dries. The round NESCO dehydrator is not efficient at making best use of tray space when making straight lengths of jerky, but they now make a new square model, recently purchased, and has adjustable temperatures.

review | stuff | sauce | aficionado | heat | pain | go | point | buy | ghost | pepper | expect | step | scale | dish | version | err | put | insanity | lava | matter | preference | look,"Since reviews for several different hot sauces seem to be lumped together here, my review is for Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia Hot Sauce.

This stuff is hot. But for a seasoned hot sauce aficionado this is not the ultimate in heat or pain. If you have conquered Dave's Original Insanity Hot Sauce then this is not going to impress you. This is disappointing because the whole point of buying ghost pepper hot sauce is for extreme heat.

Do not be fooled though, this stuff IS hot. And if you aren't seasoned this is plenty hot to put you in serious pain. But since this is ghost pepper sauce I was expecting something hotter than original Insanity Sauce and this is not it. It's a step below on the heat scale. Not a big step below but still below. With Insanity Sauce I have to be more careful about how much I put into my dish. But with this ghost pepper version I find myself erring on the side of putting in too much rather than not enough. This one is more forgiving. Also, while the original insanity sauce is thick like lava, this is runny like regular Tabasco Sauce. Whether that is better or not is a a matter of personal preference.

That being said, this one is still good for those times when I don't want to go all out so it's not without its merits. But if you're looking for ultimate in heat, this is not it.",I was really disappointed that Avon discontinued this stuff because it's so delicious and aficionado.

Is this just snake oil or is he truly a master of methane?

Upon ingesting his delicious elixir of capsaicin, I felt a slight watering of my eyes and the urge to sneeze overcame me and read again the directions, only to find there is no recommended dosage. I also had to wonder if using a straw up my nose was the correct application method.

I could only assume it to be a single dose bottle and so I continued to consume the medicine, only stopping to occasionally clear my sinus palate with sorbet. Approximately half gone, my straw beginning to dissolve, I looked at the bottle and found that the Professor's picture had become animated and was telling me to turn around and to look...and there was my dog...with Jack Nicholson's head upon it's body! Grabbing my cape and cane I hurried out, flagged down a handsome and spent the night performing death defying leaps upon the rooftops of London...or so I thought.

Long story, but I was hospitalized and apparently blathering on about colon cleansing while in my stupor and so they went ahead and performed a colonoscopy and pronounced me free of bowel disease.

I must say, the good professor appears to have a sound product that lives up to his claims and is also quite tasty...but the packaging could be improved upon by including a dosage and where to put it.

Okay, the truth on this product. I wish I could buy it at a lower price and in quantity, because I can use up the bottle in two weeks I like it so much. It's not too hot and it's...Zesty?...and a nice variation if you like milder hot sauces that also include many other flavors besides hot. I still use ""wicked hot"" hot sauces, but I also enjoy Tobasco Chipotle sauce as a table sauce these days too, which is much milder than the original.","I agree with several of the other reviewers.

This is North Carolina real.

Here's the deal, in NC we don't use a BBQ sauce like y'all do over in Memphis, KC, or Texas except on chicken, sometimes.  This is a finishing sauce - not a cooking sauce. We use it on pig, after the pig has been cooked. In fact, we're known to cook the shoulder with nothing but the meat and fat and then season it after it's pulled.  It's mighty fine right off the heat plain but some folks like a little tang and a little bite - that's what this is for.

Another thing about this one - it's not that thick and gooey ketchup looking stuff you'd pour over some ribs or brisket - this is a thin vinegar base.  There's no sugar and fat in here to caramelize on your oven baked ""BBQ Chicken"" - that's not what this is for at all.

A huge hint might be the picture of a pig on the bottle.  Use it on pork!  Pulled pork.  Another hint is the color, it's not exactly ""sweet and mild"" - it's sharp and hot.  Not hot sauce hot - you can add that too if you want.

If you'd like something close to a Central/Piedmont/Lexington NC style pulled pork sauce you remember from that trip down I85/I95/I40 -- this be the goods.  If you'd like a basting sauce like the use over in Kansas, this ain't it.

Did I mention, ""finishing sauce"" -- not a cooking sauce.  And very-very authentic to restaurant fare in much of North Carolina.  Because that's what's on the table in much of North Carolina.","I was really sad that this was only available to the public, and I couldn't live without it.

Most shrimp paste is made by mixing fresh shrimp with salt, pulverizing the combination, then letting it  sit outside to dry in open tanks. (Which can be kinda dicey in places like China, where there's rampant air pollution.) This is what the  company's US website said: **""Lee Kum Kee has improved the traditional processing techniques by selecting the best silver shrimp and drying them in a pollution-free greenhouse instead of constantly exposing them to outdoor conditions. This ensures our products are produced in hygenic conditions and guarantees food safety. The shrimp are fermented and dried without adding any preservatives, MSG or artificial coloring so they retain their natural taste.""**  That sold me on it. (Amazon also had it for less than than the manufacturer's website.) Unlike every other shrimp paste I've tried, Lee Kum Kee isn't a hard, caked powder. I opened the jar to find a thick pudding consistency, with all the robust shrimp flavor you get from the usual versions of shrimp paste. Because it's wet, you definitely need to refrigerate it once opened. (Bacteria love a wet environment.) But I'm thrilled that I no longer have to use a hammer to break off pieces from a block of shrimp paste. Now, I can spoon out a precise measurement that I don't have to dissolve in boiling water before I can cook with it.",I recently had this amazing shrimp sauce from Whole Foods and this salty paste from Whole Foods is just divine. It's so delicious and so delicious! I have been using it for about 10 years and it has been discontinued

This brand seemed to be of good quality and fresh, as well as being reasonably priced. We live in the country and don't have any stores that would carry such things, so I was really glad to find it online.

flavoring | meat | taste | prerogative | try | ground | beef | batch | gun | set | master | express | room | temperature | total | math | burger | season | sell | thing | oz | worth | jerky | love | diet | hike,"TL:DR First off, why 3 stars and not 5... 1: Too much ""Original"" Flavoring, 3 packs for 6# of meat which makes up 25% of the flavorings. 2ndly: The teriyaki taste absolutely nothing like REAL teriyaki or even close to ""Teriyaki"".

Nothing wrong so to speak with the Original flavoring, it just too plain for me, like plain salted chips. Some of you enjoy that, and its your prerogative so go for it and enjoy!

Ill be trying the other flavors soon and will comment on them when I do.

I use 2# of 20/80 ground beef per batch using the Plain Nesco Jerky gun included in my set, 3 clicks gives you nice 5"" strips which shrink down to 4ish. With my Nesco Snack master express set at 160*, 2# of burger strips takes roughly 4 hours at 70* Ambient room temperature which yields me 50 strips totaling 1# dry.

Math:
2# burger at $1.99/#
Seasoning for 2# $1.97
Electricity >$1 for 4 hours

That comes out to less than $7 for 1#  of prepared Jerky.

Now, stores selling the same thing would cost you roughly $3 for 5 strips/ 1.6 oz, so $30 worth of jerky per batch.

For people that love jerky, are on a high Protein / Keto diet, hike, Prep, etc... you can't go wrong with these mixes, they pay for themselves with the 1st batch.","I'm a big fan of jerky meat, and this is my prerogative. I usually leave it on my meat for six months, and I don't have time to wash it, especially since my meat is so"

I really don't know how I got this illness but I soon experience extreme exhaustion and weariness from work very often so I ended up asking the opinion of my physician. He informed me that I have active virus which eats up most of my energy so I end up tired and confused.

I managed to hold on to my job thanks to the Gene Eden VIR 101 product which was given to me by my friend in the US. He himself is using it to combat latent chronic viral infection which results to lesser efficacy of the body's immune system. I am recovering fairly well after taking Gene Eden as my regular supplement but I wanted to perform the previous activities I enjoyed doing like regular gym work-outs and long walks in the park. Ever since I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome I was limited by my doctor to do strenous activities but with the aid of Gene Eden I feel long lasting boosting energy flowing through my blood stream.

I tried to combine Power Bar with one of my walks in the park and I was amazed how it kept my energy level high. I believe the electrolytes contained in these energy bar is sufficient to keep the cells of my body going.

I plan to do an hour of aerobic routine next week and is optimistic that both Power Bar and Gene Eden will not fail me.

Thank you very much for giving me a chance to live my previous life once again. I just hope eating much of Power bar won't make me fat in any way.",I have been using this supplement for the past 6 years and I have noticed the symptoms have improved.

Some of my family's favorite Chinese restaurant dishes are Potstickers, Broiled Wings, Egg Foo Yung, Moo Goo Gai Pan, Fried Rice and any chicken dishes. I found all these in my favorite old cook book from 1983- Better Homes And Gardens Cooking Chinese.  To say the recipes are exactly like our favorite Chinese restaurant dishes would be an understatement. These recipes are THE BEST and even better than the restaurant's dishes.

My second favorite cook book is also an older book- from 1981-Betty Crocker's Chinese Cookbook by Leeann Chin. There are no Potsticker recipes, but so many delicious chicken ones are in here. The Potstickers are a very time consuming labor of love, so I learned to put a day aside to make them. Once you make the delicious dough, you seal the cooked pork or beef filling inside, not cooking the Potsticker yet, then I wrap up 6 at a time in saran wrap. I then double wrap them and seal them in a freezer bag. I keep them in the freezer until I need them. Because they take so long to prepare, I make a double batch- having dozens to freeze- they stay perfect for a few months in the freezer. When I want to make them- I just take them from the freezer to the refrigerator, and leave them in the refrigerator all day thawing (at least 5 hours). They are then ready to easily cook- I just brown the bottoms for a minute with a tiny bit of oil, then add water, cover and 10-12 minutes later, they are ready to eat.

The sauces really make the Potstickers and bring the WOW flavor to them. Most recipes say to use Rice Vinegar and Soy Sauce together, but I found using the Black Vinegar with Soy Sauce is a thousand times more delicious! We then found we love to use this sauce on everything- over rice, chicken, ribs, Potstickers- it is too delicious for words. Black Vinegar is simply rice vinegar with caramel and a couple more ingredients, and it has a sweeter, smoky flavor that is out of this world! For the Best Dipping Sauce ever, you simply use equal parts Black Vinegar and Soy Sauce. We use the Light Soy Sauce, as we have to watch the sodium, and after trying a few diffferent brands of Black Vinegar, we found Koon Chun's Black Vinegar is so delicious! After stirring the equal parts Light Soy Sauce and Black Vinegar together, you just add thinly sliced green onions in- and that's it! The BEST Dipping Sauce ever! Rice Vinegar is more sour in taste and not as delicious, and in comparison the smoky sweetness of the Chinese Black Vinegar can't be beat!

Finding the delicious Koon Chun Black Vinegar is very difficult to find in my area. There are very few Asian Stores and the two that we have do not carry this Koon Chun brand. When I found Amazon carries the Koon Chun Black Vinegar, I was thrilled. The price is on the high side, but worth every penny, as there is just no flavor that comes close to Black Vinegar.  When it comes to the most delicious dipping sauces that really bring the WOW factor to all our favorite Chinese dishes- Koon Chun's Black Vinegar is it! Our favorite Potstickers never tasted this good from any Chinese restaurant!","I've been eating Chinese food for a while now and this is the only place where I can find it. I don't have any family recipes, so we can all buy it together. The chicken books are mostly about the chicken"

When it's cooled a bit, we add chopped hard boiled eggs, some salt and pepper, a bit of Frenches mustard, and Kewpie mayo.

You've spent a fair amount of time exploring the likes of Sriracha, Frank's, Crystal and Tabasco, but honestly, you need more oomph. This sauce is a great place to continue your fiery journey. Just beyond the horizon of Cayenne peppers, which they use to produce the mild, aforementioned mass-produced Louisiana-style sauces - lies a big family of chil peppers waiting to meet you. In this case, El Yucateco took the unripened green Habaero and made a sauce out of it. And it's darn good! Like many folks, you'll most likely discover this for the first time on the tables of smaller, more authentic, out-of-the-way Mexican restaurants. Yeah the color's a little too Kermit-like, but the sauce is smooth & tangy with just enough bite around the corner to lift your mouth spirits. It's not a direct assault - but it will linger for a while, like a grade-school crush. Let me also recommend two things: Firstly, you should definitely be able to find this in Latin supermarkets for a ridiculously good deal - like $3.00 for the 8oz bottle - or - check the 'Ethnic' food aisle at any generic supermarket - if you're in luck, they'll have it.

brother | chiiehead | range | flavor | standby | try | shipping | cost | buy | quantity,"My brother is a chiiehead and he warned me about Blair's being 'hot'. Blair's make a whole range of hot sauces, some of which are indeed outrageously high in Scoville units. This one however is quite good and about 6 times hotter than a Jalapeno. This is noticeably hotter than Tabasco but the flavor is similar to Tabasco. So, if you like that venerable standby but want something more, give this a try.

Shipping is a significant cost if you are buying a small quantity.","I am an avid chiiehead fan. I purchased this to serve as my standby for my chiiehead. It also comes in large quantities, so I can order it anytime."

The tea gives you a great boost of energy without the usual effect of jitters if you overdue caffeine (IMO).
Love the taste and it brews nicely. If you get just Mate (tea) it is so fine some of it ends up in your cup if you try to use a loose tea screen. This is a blend of black tea and Mate in a no-string attached tea bag. Great taste of black tea and the energy boost of Mate.","I recently had a Starbucks coffee while I was drinking tea.

I love the ease and convenience of this tea, but wish the flavor were better.  Not only is the tea very weak (I need to use three bags to obtain the flavor of one traditional tea bag), it has a slightly ""off"" taste as well.
It is also a good product in that you can toss a bag into your water bottle before you leave home and have tea for the road with no fuss.
It isn't undrinkable, and we're finishing off our boxes slowly but surely; but my entire family would much rather drink traditionally brewed Stash Peach tea.","I love the convenience of having water in your camper while camping, especially if it is warm.

I make iced tea of some type every day and I had high hopes for this. But truthfully, this tastes terrible, and I am accused by friends and family of liking almost anything! The up front taste is bland at best but the aftertaste is just strange. Peach? Peach is my single favorite flavor and this tastes nothing like peach. I figured out the problem. Take one of the bags and put in in a cold glass of water by the string and watch carefully while you dip up and down. What you see is very different than traditional tea leaves. You will see a powdery substance disolving in the tea. So aha! That is how they have it ready in 5 minutes. This is mostly a powdered tea, not steeped from real leaves like traditional tea. Yeah, there are tea leaves in there, but the flavor is coming from the powder. Then the tast problem hit me. You know that horrific Lipton powdered ice tea stuff? Are youi cringing recalling that strange taste? Well, that is the same flavor, albeit much weaker in this stuff. As usual in life, there aren't many short cuts if you want the really good stuff. Make tea the right way and skip this stuff. In the interest of truth in labelling, this should be called powdered instant tea.","I am a diehard a tea fan. Every single day our family gets together to eat tea, and I get compliments all the time. I don't have a problem with tea, it's pure tea,"

Now THIS after Hostess took away his twinkies (Amazon has been wheeling & dealing in $500 a box Twinkies, so they must be in cahoots with Hostess). This has contributed to his anxiety, which means MORE XANAX to tone that boy down. Very very hard for a 42 yr. old boy to deal with! He did say, however, that it DOES taste like chicken.

smell | coffee | morning,What is better than the smell of strong coffee in the morning? This reminds you of mornings in New Orleans.

For me, it was just barely edible. I read some other reviewers saying that they only use 1/2 a pack of cure per pound and I'm going to try that on the next batch. I keep my jerky in the fridge and it's usually gone within a couple weeks, so the reduced cure salt shouldn't affect preservation.","I have been using this stuff for years, and I have learned the hard way that seasoning can be very costly.

Even tastes good when made with skim milk.  It is also very easy to make.  I also recommend the lemon flavor of this product.  However, the key lime flavor had a bit of an artificial taste to it.","I love this product!! I used it with no sugar taste, but I do like it. I have a sweet taste that I can't live without.

This vanilla quickly became a permanent part of my kitchen.  If you are used to alcohol based vanilla extract, you are in for a serious treat.  And if you've been getting the cheap stuff at the grocery store, you are in for the vanilla heaven surprise of your LIFE!  I bought this with one intention - I wanted to make vanilla whipped cream for pancakes and waffles (YUM!), and found that vanilla extract affected the flavor and texture of the cream with the alcohol taste.  This has no alcohol and is much more concentrated in flavor and body.  So . . . .after having a culinary orgasm with the vanilla whipped cream waffle . . . . I poured the rest of my mix into my fresh roasted coffee.  O.  M.  G.  To die for.  Holy crap, there IS a food god and she (yes, she) blessed all of us with this amazing product.  Ok, so then my wife and I both got a bit obsessed with this vanilla flavor and started experimenting and putting it in everything.  Here are some other uses we didn't think of at first but turned out to be absolutely AWESOME:
* Mix with cinnamon and maple syrup and spread on toast or French toast
* Mix in a tablespoon into cola for the most AMAZING vanilla soda
* Add some to bread or cake - it works great in a breadmaker machine without affecting the recipe
* Mix with coconut oil and coffee grinds to make an amazing vanilla latte body scrub (my wife's idea)
* Add to your smoothie.
* Pour over ice cream
* Make the most fantastic home-made ice cream - We use either raw milk cream or coconut cream with sugar and this vanilla in our Cuisinart ice cream maker
So there ya have it, our best ideas for vanilla pleasure.  Out of all the uses, my favorite is mixing this with cream in my coffee and laugh at how Starbucks doesn't even come close to how amazing my morning coffee is (:

This faintly green powder is mixed with water to make a thick paste to get wasabi, used for sushi, sashimi and to flavor tuna and other dishes.
One trick is to mix the wasabi in a rice bowl or tea bowl and turn the bowl upside-down. Yes, that's what I said, turn it over. The paste will stick in the bowl, and the developing sulfurous gases that make wasabi hot, hot, hot are retained, improving the bite. Get that wasabi buzz.
I like to use it in tuna with wasabi-potato crust. Or being short on time, I just grill some yellowtail and mix a wasabi-sugar-soy sauce glaze and brush it on at the end of the grilling. Hot and sweet. Another totally bizarre but quite normal Japanese dish is wasabi nori chazuke, or tea-rice. Get some leftover rice warmed up in a bowl, put a dab of wasabi and a sprinkle of sushi nori strips. Pour hot green tea (bancha) over and drink like a soup. Said to be a cure for hangover (I wouldn't know, but they say it works.)","I was lucky enough to find this in a few places near my home.

All that is required to send your mouth on fire is one drop. I just had a dab and my tongue was on fire.

This sauce is made with the Hottest Pepper in the World, The Naga Jolokia.

It wasn't so hot I couldn't handle it but i'm sure if I had more than that dab I'd be in for more than I could handle. The sensation from the dab lasted a good 15 minutes.

The sauce contains the ghost pepper, hot pepper extract, salt, vegetable oil, roasted garlic pulps and acetic acid. It's a delicious addition to many foods- especially sauces, meat and ethnic foods. Not for people with heart/respiratory problems.

Amazon has the best price i've seen on the sauce so far. So, if you like it spicy and you want to try a sauce with the Ghost Pepper in it, I Highly Recommend it...

array | hope | segment | sauce | market | brand | star | rating | bit | sampler | introduction | heat | tomato | garlic | brown | green | chipotle | class | jalapeo | pepper | shame,"El Yucateco makes some decent hot sauces but like many companies, they produce a confusing array of hot sauces - each different - hoping to capture every possible segment of the hot sauce market. This brand is rarely great but usually reliable - hence my two star rating which may be a bit harsh. The Chipotle and Jalapeo varieties are excellent - 4 or 5 star.

This sampler will give you a good introduction. The brown Habanero is quite potent - mostly fiery heat. The red Habanero is almost as hot but has some tomato mixed in. The green Habanero has a bit of garlic and is still quite potent. Yet the brown is the hottest - mostly pure heat. I personally prefer the green.

The Chipotle sauce is in an entirely different class, made from a smoked dried jalapeo pepper. No where as hot as the above but truly excellent.

El Yucateco almost makes a superb jalapeo sauce that is not included in this sampler, which is a shame.","I was really hoping this segment would be okay but the other ones I've tried seem to outnumber them as being similar to the ones I've tried too, including the spaghetti sauce and rhubarb.

That way, you have a wild, free range food source.  Your herd will get the best free food possible by going out and eating all of your neighbors flowers.  Marigolds really impart something great to the flavor of the meat.  Sunflower plants also give them a really nice mild flavor.

That way, it cost you nearly nothing (except of course the cost and toil of raising your lovely garden initially) to have a readily available and fresh food source at hand.

With the radio collars, you can easily track where your herd is currently foraging.  Whether it be down the street on cranky old Mrs. Hagersteins prized flower, or on your hippie neighbors cherished ""Organic and sustainable"" vegan garden.

Plus, everyone knows that wild, so called ""nuisance"" pests are the absolute lowest fat, and have the best diet.

Good idea though, all the same!  I just like my food source to be ""free range"".

I always add extra cracked black pepper and crushed red pepper with all of these packets when combining to ground meat. I do use ground meat to make jerky using a jerky gun to form it into shape. By doing this, you get flavor throughout the entire pieces of jerky. The best thing about these packet compared to others that I have used is the cure also comes in individual packets that are pre-measured. Also, it is not too salty like some other jerky spices that I have used that make you measure out the cure from a bulk packet.

Normally, I don't like French Roast coffee, and I wasn't sure at first about what the addition of chicory would do to the flavor. I've always made mild-flavored coffee. I read somewhere that the chicory mellows out the flavor of the French roast coffee. Well, maybe, originally, the chicory was added to stretch the coffee that was available, but it does not add an odd flavor to the coffee and, maybe, it does mellow the dark roast flavor. All I know is that I really love this coffee. A great way to start the day.","I like that Coke is not sold on a trip to the gym, but I do want to find something that isn't too expensive.

If you want to really augment the taste of the almonds, and lower the phytic acid content, it is very easy to roast them. I did it in this manner:

I have a small, square, Pyrex glass baking dish that fits perfectly into my toaster oven. I set the toaster oven for 350 degrees and turned to the Bake setting. I then spread a thin layer of nuts in the bottom of the ungreased baking dish. I place it in the toaster oven, and set a timer for 5 minutes. When it goes off, I remove the baking dish with a hot pad, shake the dish to resettle and redistribute the nuts, place the dish back in the toaster oven, and set a timer for another 5 minutes. At the end of this time, the almonds are deliciously toasted.","Very high quality. I have received no favors from people that I taste similar things but the actual product itself is much higher in quality. In many ways, they don't have the right acid content, as suggested in the instructions. I"
kick | fire | flavor | lot | fruit | bottle | spice | level | sauce,"I looove hot sauces. However, I found the Ghost Pepper one to be ""meh."" It's got quite a kick. Several drops will definitely do. I don't mind the fire at all but I'm really not that crazy about the flavor. It's a lot like Tobasco. I didn't get the fruit flavor that others have written about.

I personally prefer Cheyenne or habanero flavor but always want waaay more kick. I think I'll buy another bottle of Frank's and mix some of this to boost the spice level but keep the flavor I like.

I'd also really like to try other Dave's sauce because they probably have a different one that I'd really love but it seems they're mostly unavailable now.

In my opinion, the sparkles are flavorless once added to frosting, icing and the like. I think it's the texture that's odd. I mean it's odd in the best sense of the word. There is something to be said about the unique texture it gives to your finished goodies. It's snow-like; I'd even say glass-like. It especially looks cool when you match the color of sparkles to the color of icing (e.g. pink icing with pink sparkles). I can't think of anything else on the market comparable to this. I've tried it on flooded icing when making sugar cookies and frosted cupcakes. I think it's worth trying. I like it!","I have no opinion on this flavor.

We eat a lot of almonds and it turns out it's hard to beat our California almonds.  These are grown in Spain so are probably a different variant of almond than were used to.  They are small and we didn't like the taste as much or the dusty / powdery / dirtiness and washed them before using.  There is a lot more of the skin that you have to contend with and once I bit into one that was like a stone it was so hard.  We have decided to throw the rest out and not buy again.,I have been using this product for years and I was first introduced to it in Madera in the early 90's and for some years had them ship me the product until I found a variant with almond in it.

When I heard they had done a strawberry gum, I wondered is it was good. Well, it could've been more with Orbit's Strawberry Remix gum. It tastes alright at first, but easily loses it flavor, faster than any gum that I have tasted in awhile. The strawberry flavor doesn't last long, only a couple of minutes and quickly goes away. I really didn't feel that it could be a flavor I would want to continuous buy.

This is the best vanilla worth the price of saffron. It will taste like vanilla and will make your house smell like vanilla, no alcohol aftertaste. However, the price on Amazon varies so check your local prices before purchasing it.

I can't speak the tea lover's lingo (full-bodied, smoky with hints of arsnic, etc.) but this tea is decent.  I use it mostly to make iced tea but I drink it hot occasionally too.  I have been completely spoiled on Dilmah tea & now any others seem inferior.  Lipton Yellow Label is definitely better than PG Tips! I initially bought PG Tips and could never make a cup of hot tea that did not have a bitter after taste.  I thought it was my brewing technique until I tasted better teas.

today | yesterday | flavor | size | number | description | brand | claim | grade | system | way | sense | peanut | oil | fact | soybean | opinion | couple | bite,"Just received my first can today.  I wanted to compare them with my favorite Virginia peanuts from Royal Oak I received yesterday.  I had them open side by side.  Feridies peanuts are saltier, but not to me objectionably so.  Their flavor is as good as Royal Oak, but no better.  The size of Feridies peanuts are SMALLER than the Royal Oak.  Among the Royal Oak peanuts are a number that can truly be considered ""extra, extra"" large.  I didn't find one in the Feridies can that could match that description.  Of course even Costco brand makes the same claim to size and they aren't.  I wonder if there actually is an official grading system for size.  I doubt it.  Both are crunchy but in a different way.  The Royal Oak peanuts are blistered while the Feridies are not.  Yet both are crunchy.  Taste wise they are both the same which makes sense since they are both cooked in peanut oil.  In fact many Virginia grown peanut brands are not.  Others use cheap soybean oil to cook their peanuts.  The heads of those companies should be taken out and shot, at least in my opinion.  I give Feridies peanuts four stars while I give Royal Oak fiver stars.  Why?  Because Royal Oak is cheaper by a few bucks per can.

1/21/2018  I now notice that Feridies is a couple of dollars per can cheaper than Than Royal Oak.  However, the latest two cans i received of the Feridies contain smaller peanuts than ever before.  Yes, small nuts have a different bite than the larger ones.  Well, back to Royal Oak.","I'm a bit skeptical about this brand, as I thought it might be a little weird but I like it.

season | ground | beef | jerky | dehydrating | system | packaging | quality | taste | change | cure | seasoning | plastic | middle | improvement | foil | paper | spice | grinder | stuff | kind | way | couple | half,"This is my go-to jerky seasoning for my ground beef jerky.  I've got a complete Nesco dehydrating system and this was the very first seasoning I ever tried.  It's changed it's packaging over the years, but it's always the same high quality flavorful taste we've come to expect.

With the latest change to packaging, the cure and the seasoning are in two separate plastic pouches joined in the middle.  This is such a huge improvement over the old separate, foil-lined paper pouches.  With this packaging now the seasoning doesn't clump and form blocks that need a spice grinder to break apart.  So much easier.

The taste is amazing.  Everyone who's ever tried my jerky says they like it when they taste it at first but then each of them has come up to me later and told me again how incredible it was.  This stuff literally makes you crave more.  It's evil in the best kind of way.

I've probably made a couple hundred pounds of jerky over the years and this has made up more than half of it.  I'll continue to buy it and win people over.

He did remark, however, that the flavor was quite excellent, and proceeded to finish his breakfast with gusto.

Crushed that not only my plan had backfired, and that I was now out of a job, I locked myself in my apartment. Assuming I had gotten the dosage wrong, I proceeded to drink the rest of the bottle, hoping to propel myself off this mortal coil with wings of chipotle flame.

love | experiment | lot | brand | reason | flavor | character | balance | factor | profile | palate | garlic | surprise | aspect | salt | quality | bite | spiciness | serrano | pepper | bird | eye | sauce | jalapeno | hand | habanero | fry | base | dab | make | scampi | dish | teaspoon | gram | mg | sodium | fact | condiment | lieu | treat | shortcut | spot | pantry,"I love hot sauces and love experimenting with various ones. Lately I have been using a lot of products from this brand and this one is among my favorites.

The reason I love it is the flavor and the piquant character balance one another. Of course the piquant factor dominates the flavor profile (although this is not super spicy to my palate). The garlic is easily detected, but the surprise is the sweet aspect of the flavor profile, which seems to dominate more than the salt.

About the piquant quality - this does have a slight bite and some spiciness, but if you can tolerate a serrano pepper you will not have any problems. For me I prefer a little more spiciness so I will often add some finely chopped bird's eye chilis to the sauce. Of course spiciness is both subjective and relative. If a jalapeno is too hot for you may want to avoid this. On the other hand, if a habanero is not enough, you will have to kick it up with additional peppers.

To me it's all about flavor and this one has it. It not only works with stir fry dishes, but also in American dishes like grilled beans and as the base for stews and soups. A dab of this when making scampi will add a lot to that dish as well.

Nutritionally a teaspoon contains only 10 calories and a single gram of carbs. However, it also contains 410mg of sodium, so if you have restrictions note that and use this sparingly. In fact, use it as a condiment in lieu of salt on some dishes for a real treat.

If you love spicy sauces and want to fuse Chinese flavors into your tried and true menus, or to make authentic Chinese dishes this is a great shortcut. It's earned a spot in my pantry.","I adore this brand because the flavor is so fresh and clean, just wish I could find it. I also love that it has a lot of herbs and spices in it and I'm totally sold on this brand. The main reason"

But like most  things, moderation is the key. And this stuff is tasty enough to be worth cutting back a little on salt in other things the days I use it to compensate.","I purchased thisbottle for myself, and I haven't given it to anyone.

vanilla | flavor | difference | fact | bread | chocolate | chip | ice | cream | brand,"After using Nielsen Massey's Pure Vanilla Extract I would never be able to go back to using cheap artificial vanilla.

I use this in banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, custards and ice cream. Basically anything that calls for vanilla is better with this more expensive brand. In fact, I don't want to run out of it so I currently have four bottles. I guess I can't live without it.

They arrived promptly and appeared to be in excellent condition. I was actually impressed with their large size, shape and foliage. They were intended as gifts for family and friends.

I quarantined them from my other houseplants which displayed no similar problems.

The mystery of the disappearance of Thumper, on par with that of Judge Crater and Jimmy Hoffa, came to a shocking end yesterday when a gory photograph of the famous actor was posted on the Amazon web site.

Clues in the photograph, showing Thumper's headless and trussed body, led California Private Investigator, Edward ""Eddie"" Valiant to the Cloverdale processing plant where Thumper's long and fabled life had evidently ended.

""Who would do such a dastardly thing to my uncle?""  sobbed  family spokesman Roger Rabbit, who is Thumper's nephew and also a known Hollywood actor, at the mobbed press conference held hours after the gristly discovery. ""If I hadn't hired Eddie Valiant to get the job done, the cops would still have their heads down a rabbit hole!"" and ""Where the %@*& is my uncle's head?""

Born Oscar Q Rabbit to a theatrical family of animated characters specializing in animal roles, Rabbit was hired by the Disney Studios when just a tiny bunny. Nicknamed ""Thumper"" for an endearing but nervous twitch of the left hind foot, he eventually became known throughout the world by that single name, joining the exclusive rank of one named stars such as Cher, Madonna and Pele.

Cast as a child character in a small supporting role in the movie Bambi in 1942, Thumper's adorable and enduring persona lit the screen with a charisma way beyond that of a humble sidekick.

A memorable line in Bambi became the touchstone of Thumper's life. ""If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all!"" formed the basis of what is now known as ""The Thumperian Principle"" . Grown to a world movement, Thumperian disciples believe in the tenant that bad grammar and good deeds are cosmically linked.

Thumper continued work at the Disney Studios with Thumper2 and Thumper Goes Exploring but was eventually released from his contract when as a young adult, despite desperate efforts, he could not control the twitch in his hind leg. Rumors of drug abuse were never proven although Thumper spent several months at a private hospital for reported exhaustion  after completing the filming Thumper Goes Exploring.

Never making the transition to television as did his younger relatives, Crusader Rabbit and Bugs Bunny, Thumper's career floundered until he was reduced to starring in three rabbitsploitation movies, ""Suck My Carrot"", ""Young Bunny Coed Love"", and finally, ""The Bunny Hole"".

A long time alcoholic and well known visitor to the watering holes along the Sunset Strip and Las Vegas, Thumper lent his name to what has become a popular drinking game.

Thumper spent his final years prior to his disappearance making celebrity appearances at Bambi reunions and Thumperian conferences and spent two seasons on Hollywood Squares where the muffled thumping of his hind led could often be heard in the background.

Thumper was the founder and president of the ""Shake A Leg Foundation"" a research and charitable organization for rabbits and other small mammals suffering from hind leg movement disorder. Contributions to the foundation can be made in his name.

Thumper is survived by his older brother, Benjamin Bunny, his nephew, Roger Rabbit, and his fourth wife, Jessica Rabbit and 974 children.","...that is why I love this film.

I've been making jerky for years now, and switched to ground beef jerky about 2 years ago because the dentist said it would be easier on my husband's teeth, so I bought the LEM Jerky Cannon and got busy.  Using a liquid-based seasoning makes for a very tasty jerky, but it squirts a lot of liquid out while extruding the ground beef onto the drying trays, so I thought I'd take the easy way out and try a prepackaged mix.

The Jerky Cannon came with one packet of a spice mix and we thought it was pretty good.  When looking to replace that, I came across all the good reviews of this Nesco product, so I went ahead and ordered the 18 pack.  I got 5 pounds of 88% lean beef, mixed in 5 packets of the mix, extruded, turned on the dehydrator, and waited.

A few hours later, it was dry.  I've also found that the jerky tastes better the next day, but I couldn't resist trying it right out of the dehydrator.  I found it pretty bland, but figured it would be better after being refrigerated and let the flavors meld.  Nope! Still very bland and with a bit of an ""odd"" taste I couldn't quite put my finger on.

So, I mixed up some soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder and red pepper flakes and coated each dried strip of jerky with that, then put it back into the dehydrator for an hour to dry it all out again.  This is at least tasty enough to eat.

Not sure WHAT I'm gonna do with the other 13 packets of spice mix, but I sure won't bother to use it in my jerky again.  I'm giving 2 stars because it's not HORRIBLE, it's just not GOOD, or at least, it's not to our tastes.  I won't be buying it again.",I like using stuff as opposed to making things with soy sauce and pepper. I have a lot of teeth so I have to find a way to get them all off like we do with our mouths.

It is not... apparently it's just regular European horseradish grown in Japan.  The ingredient list contains horseradish, mustard, corn flour and corn starch, and a bunch of artificial colors.  In that regard, needless to say, I was disappointed, although for roughly $8 I can't have too much buyer's remorse.

Taste-wise, however, the product is fine, and is exactly like the fake wasabi paste everyone is used to from most sushi restaurants.  I take 1/4 teaspoon of the powder in a bowl, and add water drop-wise while rolling it with my fingertip until I get the right consistency.  I'll continue to use the rest this product (it'll probably last me a year) because it has a nice pungent horseradish taste that indeed complements my take-home sushi well.

The smoky flavor of chipotles is the main star in this sauce of course, and has a lovely tangy/sweet balance.  This sauce is very versatile I have found, being good right out of the bottle with cheeze and crackers, or as a condiment with cooked meats.  The heat is rather mild, allowing you to get as much of the great flavor of this sauce onto your dishes as you wish.

chai | experience | paper | tea | packet | blend | style | hill | web | site | flavor | profile | cinnamon | creamy | spice | medium | kick | ginger | cardamom | pepper | tazo | aroma | brewing | trick | have | turn | star | company | motto | type | focus | check | wording | vague | premium,"****

Tazo's Chai Black Tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the Himalayas."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Chai as ""cinnamon, creamy, sweet spice"" and ""medium-bodied yet full-flavored, with the spicy kick of cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and black pepper. Tazo describes the aroma as ""sweet, spice"". Those are pretty accurate. The black tea ""blend"" is a little bitter, though, even with minimal brewing. It's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter.

The ingredients in Chai are: black teas, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, cardamom, cloves, and star anise. It is caffeinated.

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Chai gets only four stars.

You could ground the flax seeds yourself, or you can buy a great product like this one by Spectrum.  Ground flax is a wonderful addition to your diet--just 2 TB adds protein (3g), fiber (3g), and healthy fats.

I was expecting a real potent punch, but upon reading that it had yerba mate in it, which I  drank in one of my favorite Chai mixes, I was sure it would be palate pleasing and I was right! This tea is very simple, as the ingredients list is short; roasted mate and black tea- no fillers, no funny stuff and no funky herbs and spices.  Upon further search on the internet of it I found out that Yerba Mate is an herb that is traditionally prepared as an energizing tea and consumed by natives of South American countries as it contains high concentrations of antioxidant flavonoids possessing potent free radical quenching activity.  It also includes several B vitamins, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Beta-Carotene and Calcium. Mixed with black tea, the Mate tastes like dark chocolate, just a hint mixed with the tea, it's a subtle yet an eye opening experience upon the first sip.

I try to take good care of my health and drink lots of tea and water, but I had no idea how high in antioxidants this tea was! Per serving it had 1150mg, compared to 375 to 800 in broccoli, 600 to 900 in Tomato Juice and 650 to 1100 in Orange Juice. Tea is much easier to prepare than eating a bowl full of broccoli and drinking tomato juice, and it's quite refreshing and also tasted nice with some milk and sugar. I don't add lemon to it, just sugar and I let it soak in for about 3 minutes. Its makes a slightly smoky, chocolaty and exotic brew, yet it's still tea can be drank at breakfast or tea time. I love the cover art and the simple goodness of Celestial Seasonings, as it reaches out and transforms many coffee addicts to tea lovers

collection | today | assortment | page | course | chocolate | try | picture | item | reflection | size | lot | experience | couple | color | frosting | butter | sugar | milk | bleeding | shaker | counter | batch | shape | make | cost,"I have a huge collection of sprinkles.  I wanted to use some today and was surprised to find I hadn't even opened this particular assortment (the animals and stars one, since there are multiple items on the same page), so of course these were the ones I had to use.

I think these are really cute.  I used the stars on some chocolate cupcakes today but am now trying really hard to think of something to do with the cows.  The picture on the item page is an accurate reflection of what you'll get and is also fairly reflective of the size.

These taste vaguely sugary and have a lot of artificial colors in them.  I figure, you're only using a small amount on any one baked item, so it won't hurt me to consume small quantities.  My experience is that, if you plan to store your baked goods for more than a couple of days, the color does start to bleed out (while I hadn't opened this assortment, I had a different Wilton assortment with similar ingredients that I'd experienced this with), especially with light-colored frostings.  (I always make my own frosting with butter, powdered sugar, and milk.  I can't say for sure that the bleeding color would happen in canned frosting.)

These don't necessarily distribute evenly because the shapes are rather large and tend to clog up the holes in the shaker.  If this happens, just turn the shaker right side up again and bang it on the counter and you should be good to go.  On one batch of 12 cupcakes, I used about 1/3 of the stars.  So you should be able to get at least a couple of uses out of each shape, making these well worth the cost.","I was excited to see the new collection coming in today's issue, I decided to look it up and I did like it!

sauce | time | chili | pot | add | dozen | serranos | flavor | rest | family | spicy | supermarket | edition | thing | dime | size | bowl | heat | smokey | drop | extract | taste | use | bit | salsa,"I love Dave's Ghost Pepper hot sauce.

Most of the time when I make chili, I make myself an extremely hot pot of chili which involves adding at at least a dozen serranos and habaneros.  The flavor is amazing.  But I have to make a second pot for the rest of the family who won't eat anything that spicy.

When I do not have time, or the local supermarket is short on peppers, Dave's Insanity Ghost Pepper edition is the next best thing.  I add about a dime size drop to my bowl of chili and it brings up the heat right to where I like it, and also adds a very pleasant smokey flavor to boot!  I should say that I like it hot, and most people would use only a drop or two for a bowl of chili of the same size.

While this is an extreme hot sauce with a good amount of extract, the taste is quite passable, especially for what it is.  Obviously if you eat enough at one time, you will taste extract but in use enough, you will taste extract, but it's hot enough where you don't need to use that much as a little bit will heat up your bowl of chili or salsa and add a very pleasant smoky flavor.

I highly recommend this.  But also, be careful.  Use too much and you'll be sorry.  This is a hot sauce where one drop may be enough.","I had never used salsa before, so I decided to try it for myself. I had a dozen of them, and I couldn't pass them up.

This was before the U.S. Government-sponsored sugar wars of the 1970s, leading the soft drink manufacturers to use cheaper high-fructose corn syrup instead. (+ History Lesson included below)

It was never a taste or health decision, purely cost. Of course we now know there are other (long term) costs: HFCS probably has plenty to do with the frightening increase in obesity and diabetes in this country. (* recent Princeton study; see link in Comments)

Coke's current U.S. offering isn't just bad FOR you. It tastes horrible, too. And despite official Coca-Cola comments to the contrary (""All of our consumer research indicates that from a taste standpoint, the difference is imperceptible""), anyone who has tasted both knows the difference. The suits in Atlanta have a vested interest in protecting their bottling partners on this side of the border. Their apparent failure at the taste test table thus becomes understandable if not acceptable.

On the other side of the border, however, Mexican Coke still uses cane sugar, which translates to pure sweetness not to mention less aftertaste. Nice heavy glass bottles add to the appeal. Find these at your local carniceria or bodega, or even by the case at some Costco or Sam's Club locations.

REFRESCO indeed!!!

P.S. If you are unable to find Mexican Coke locally and unwilling to pay the shipping premium here, just keep your eyes open next Spring for the special Passover Coke, which also forgoes the corn syrup for good old fashioned (and Kosher!) sugar.

[+ History Lesson follows]

By the late 1970s, increasing tariffs on imported sugar forced U.S. food manufacturers to develop alternative sweeteners. The answer quickly became high-fructose corn syrup, the price of which continues to be kept low through government subsidies for corn growers. Damn the taste, we know what fat Americans with dead taste buds want!","I have been using this stuff for years, and I was first introduced to it by the British government in Madera in the early 90's.

Dear Food To Live Customer Service,

You forgot the part about how FDA requires a zip code, which is not on your label.

Also, if you provide a street address or P.O. Box that would show transparency to your customers.

Look at the label of any other major food company, and you will find this information on their products.

hibiscus | y | taste | tea | berry | color | husband | pomegranate | root | acid | cinnamon | lemongrass | caffeine | company | motto | tazo | web | site | type | focus | check | wording | vague | paper | packet | tantalize | flavor | profile | wine | aroma | premium,"****

Tazo's Passion Herbal Infusion is a somewhat tart, deep, flavorful (hibiscus-y tasting) tea. It is not berry-like in taste, although it is red in color. It's difficult to describe what hibiscus tastes like, but I find it a most pleasant taste. My husband says it tastes like pomegranate to him. Although Passion contains licorice root it is not sweet.

The ingredients in Passion are: hibiscus flowers, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, orange peel, licorice root, cinnamon bark, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy. It is caffeine-free!

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""A tantalizing deep red tea made from hibiscus flowers, exotic herbs and natural tropical flavors."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as ""berry, juicy, wine-like, merlot, sweet, earthy, dense"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""sweet, juicy, red fruits"".

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Passion gets only four stars.

yucatn | sauce | travel | south | hankering | heat | area | deal | overpower | detriment | taste | characterize | habanero | multitude | sacrifice | sign | cook | dish | add | make | rice | toothpick | spoon | bit | way | minute,"El Yucateco (""one from the Yucatn"") is a powerful hot sauce. After traveling extensively in the south of Mxico, I had a hankering for the heat and tastes of the foods typical of that area. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this. There is a good deal of heat, not overpowering, and not to the detriment of the taste of the sauce.

As far as characterizing the taste, I would describe it as very ""earthy"". You definitely can detect the habanero, but there is a complex multitude of other spices that come out after the initial heat subsides. Other sauces this hot I find sacrifice unique taste for heat. A good sign is that if this sauce was not spicy, I would still use it.

I am not a very technical cook, so I cannot honestly tell you what dishes this sauce is most appropriate for. I can tell you however that it enhanced every dish I used it on, from adding heat to burritos, to making some plain rice more interesting.

I would advise those sensitive to hot sauces to first test this on a toothpick. Also when cooking with it, make sure to pour the sauce into a spoon first, because a little bit of this sauce goes a long way, and the heat does take a minute or two to start to dissipate, you wouldn't want to ruin an entire dish by adding too much heat. I would most definitely buy this sauce again!","I like how a sauce tastes. I have been traveling with lots of people and I was hankering for something like it.

We did not eat the white chocolate so I cannot say if it affected the flavor or not.

The product is actually a mostly-sugar syrup with black specks of ground vanilla beans.  I expected a more intensely ""vanilla"" product than ""extract"", but the ""paste"" is actually less intense.

EQUIVALENCES
According to the label: ""1 Tbs. vanilla paste = 1 Tbs. vanilla extract = 1 vanilla bean"".  In reality, my guess is that the paste is about half the strength of ""extract"".  Caveat, the alcohol in vanilla extract is probably a substantial portion of the vanilla-ish flavor in ""extract"".

USING
Like any syrup, it is slow to mix with cold ingredients or in cold water.  It generally requires warming or vigorous mixing to mix uniformly.

COMPARISON TO ""EXTRACT""
> ""Extract"" is vanilla flavor in alcohol. ""Paste"" is ground vanilla in sugar syrup. In my limited experience, ""extract"" is more intensely ""vanilla"" but the alcohol flavor interferes with use in uncooked (or lightly cooked) desserts--for example, in home-made ice-cream, or in a glass of vanilla-milk, or pudding.
Example: I make a faux-chocolate pudding with a tropical fruit called ""black sapote"", milk, Knox Gelatin&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knox-Original-Gelatin-32-Count-Envelopes-Unflavored-8-Ounce-Boxes-Pack-of-2/dp/B001EPQTD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knox Original Gelatin (32-Count Envelopes), Unflavored, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, sugar, and vanilla. Vanilla paste or powder works well for this purpose, but it takes alot of paste---about 1 1/2 ""heaping"" teaspoon per cup of pudding.
> The ""paste"" has the advantage of not evaporating (which can happen to extract kept for a year or two).

COMPARISON TO ""POWDER""
> ""Powder"" is simply ground vanilla; ""paste"" without the sugar.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bakto-Flavors-Ground-Vanilla-Beans-Pack-of-3-1-1-OZ/dp/B002C98W4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bakto Flavors Ground Vanilla Beans , Pack of 3-1.1 OZ</a>. In my opinion the powder is perhaps twice as intense as paste, but is comparably more expensive
> ""Powder"" is easier to mix than ""paste"".
> The lack of sugar makes it possible to make sugar-free desserts.
> Like ""paste"", the powder cannot evaporate.
> Some folks may find the brown specks objectionable in some desserts (but that applies to the ""paste"" as well).
> The powder can add an unwelcome gritty texture to pudding etc, which are supposed to be smooth.

RECOMMENDATION
Use ""extract"" for deserts which will be substantially cooked (enough to drive the alcohol off).  Use ""paste"" or ""powder"" for uncooked (or lightly cooked) deserts.

SUGGESTION
Pudding-like gelatin deserts made with milk (or real 1/2 & 1/2), gelatin, and vanilla can be lower calorie (particularly with stevia) and more nutritious than egg and starch based puddings.  Vanilla is the base to which you add other flavors, just as you start with white paint and add tints to make colored paint.  The basic recipe is one pint milk, one packet of Knox gelatin, 1 teaspoon of vanilla powder, and sweetener to taste.  Then add flavorings if desired, such as mint or lemon zest.

I've been looking for this type cookie (I used to bake them until I got old <grin>) and previously was very disappointed. These do not disappoint ... they are so good they are addictive! Thankfully there are a lot of them in this tin because nobody eats just one. They also have a long shelf life so last a long time. They can also be frozen for 6 months. David's recommends eating their OTHER cookies like pecan chocolate chip, etc. in 3 or 4 days so it's another reason why I like these so much.  I take these to any meetings or Christmas parties we go to and they are always a big hit. The people are disappointed if I do not bring them so it has become a yearly item and I purchase many of them.

BTW -- The cookies are not packed as shown; they come in the same tin but it has 4 plastic dividers inside so you do get a few less cookies but it probably helps  keep them from breaking up.","I was looking for a cookie that will hold a lot of cookies.

I really love the Indian and Thai fusion of flavors in this tea. A perfect combination I must say. I like the coconut taste in this tea, and when it comes to Thai-inspired at-home teas, this Celestial Seasonings Sweet Coconut Chai definitely tastes better than Yogi Tea's Sweet Thai Delight tea. It's also a bonus that this tea is decaffeinated, and as the other Amazon reviewers have said, this tea is definitely perfect for relaxation and before going to bed. If you like Thai-inspired teas such as this, I also suggest trying Harney and Sons' Bangkok Green Tea with Thai Flavors. It's an excellent, delicious fine tea with coconut, vanilla, ginger, and lemongrass. I also highly recommend The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf's Thai-picked Lemon Chamomile, Blueberry Peach Green Tea, and Spring Peach Oolong Teas. Another tea with some Thai influence is the Fairmont Hotels and Resorts' Organic Berry Berry Caffeine-Free tea. For cold Thai teas, I highly recommend Taste Nirvana's Real Thai Tea Latte and Real Green Tea Latte. My parents were born and raised in Thailand, and thus I'm Thai American. If you actually visit Thailand, which I have multiple times since the majority of my relatives live there, then I highly recommend trying Thai Chrysanthemum tea. I had the best tea I've ever had in my entire life in Thailand. And that's saying something because I've actually traveled up (sometimes my small traveling party and I had to walk a long and grueling hike for intervals of 30 minutes to a whole hour. Even actor Blair Underwood made a comment how he was amazed that even elderly Chinese women could climb up these mountains for long periods of time, and claimed they were in better shape than him! That's how I felt as well. If you visit China, you will see that a lot of Chinese are very physically fit - they walk, hike, bike a lot and do all sorts of exercises such as swimming and Tai Chi and fan exercises in their parks) the tea-growing terraced mountains in and around the Guilin region of China and tasted tea from those Chinese regions and also tasted some tea when I traveled to Japan, but those Asian teas don't compare to the Chrysanthemum tea I had many years back in northern Thailand. (I haven't traveled to England and India yet, but would love to. I bet the teas there are amazing. But like I said, from all the countries I've traveled to so far - Thailand has the best teas, cold and hot.) When I think about it, I was very young then, and I should have asked the Thai waitress where they got their tea from. All I know is that I drank that tea at a restaurant at a Thai hotel resort many years back in Northern Thailand not far from Chiang Rai and the Golden Triangle region. Anyways, I have given boxes of this Celestial Seasonings Sweet Coconut Thai Chai Decaf Tea as small gifts to friends in the past few years. The fact that you can order this in packs of six at an affordable price is great, and allows you the luxury to share some of this tea with friends and family. My verdict is that this is a nice aromatic, delicious tea to unwind for the day.","I have been using Tahiti to increase the value of this and its derivatives. This is my absolute favorite.

I'm not sure why they added in ""Supreme"" when the taste is delicate and profoundly different from the rest of the Earl Grey teas that you find in the market. Moreover, given than they were only founded in 1983, it shows how they have managed their brand and products in an effective manner, growing to become one of the more reputable tea manufacturers out there.

Other flavours to try: Fine Tea, Bergamot Tea. This is bound to emerge as a signature tea favourite of Harney & Sons","I fell in love with this brand because the name itself is so beautiful, and I adore how it smells.

The tin does say to brew this with boiling water - don't do that.  You'll just end up with bitter and undrinkable tea.  You have to brew this like a green tea at about 180* for about 2 minutes.  You'll have to figure out exactly how long of a steep time you prefer.

It is one of the few habanero sauces that I have ever tried that really packs a wallop!
I usually use Scorpion or Ghost pepper sauces, but sometimes I don't want terrible diarrhea, so I reach for habanero sauce instead.
This sauce offers a bright, fresh flavor that allows you to really taste the habaneros before it burns your face off.
As some people have mentioned, you can find this hot sauce in Mexican markets for about $2/bottle, but it is usually only the red or green sauce.
I can rarely find the Caribbean sauce or the Exxxtra Hot Sauce.
To be honest, the green is by far the hottest of the 4, and tastes the best.
They are all extremely hot, hotter than Tobasco by far, but Green is my favorite.
My next favorite would be Caribbean, which is sweet and almost like a jerk sauce.
Next  comes the Exxxtra Hot Sauce. It has a great smoky flavor that reminds me of Native American cooking.

I'd rate it about a 2.  It does deliver on its promise of heat, but the flavor is just nothing to write home about.  If you've ever eaten old, dried cayenne straight from the jar, that's exactly what this tastes like.  It's earthy, bitter, and simply put, lacking complexity.  The onion and garlic and stuff that are supposedly in there, just don't hit home, and the fresh pepper flavors you get with less cheaply made sauces, isn't anywhere within a mile of this bottle.  Furthermore, I can eat about a spoonful of this before I feel the full mouth, in-my-face pain.

Laird's review.  I also bought my Tea at Big Y and wish they sold Pumpkin Tea year around. This tea is my favorite.  I don't have any after taste with Stevia.  We all have different tastes with foods and drinks. I have done a lot of research with sweeteners and was surprised with what I found.  Stevia is from a plant from South America and is natural and not altered in any way. To my surprise, Sucralose (splenda)is sugar that has been treated with chlorine ! Yikes !  That is not good. The chlorine will kill the good bacteria in your intestines and cause bloating and make you feel more hungry. Sucralose is used in most diet drinks and has not been around for long enough to know how safe it is.  I am done with Sucralose and now buying soda with Stevia, like Zevia and the Steaz Tea, because they use the plant Stevia. Please don't take my word for Sucralose not being healthy for you, you need to research all the sweeteners for yourself and decide what is best for you and your family.  I won't drink anything with High Frutcose Sugar, but pure cane sugar is fine as long as too many calories is not an issue. I read other reviews on this Sweet Pumpkin Tea and they were all good, this was the only review that was that low.  Love this Tea.

April 6, 2013 added comment.

There is much discussion on artificial sweeteners.  We have aspartame, sucralose, and stevia.  We need to use the one that doesn't give us negative side effects.  I researched them all and found that stevia is from a plant in  South America, and I have no side effects from it and I prefer this to the much used sucralose, because it gave me muscle cramps in my foot and nerve pain.  When I don't use sucralose, I don't have any of those problems.  I have tested this many times.  I have no health problems, I don't drink, smoke, and I am not overweight.  I looked up sucralose and it is treat with chlorine that can reduce the good bacteria in the intestines and cause bloating.  I just use stevia now. Some say aspartame can cause brain tumors with too much use, so I don't drink that often.  Please google the Dr. Mercola story about sucralose (splenda).  That story solved my problem.

With all this talk about artificial sweeteners, then, I think that Celestial tea should sell the Pumpkin Tea with no sweeteners and we can add our own sugar, honey, or artificial sweetener of our choosing.

Celestial, Please sell the Pumpkin Tea plain.","I had a hard time using tea, and I have been using it for about 1 year. Having said that I have a lot of experience with tea, I decided to try it for myself. After a few months I got"

color | alternative | supermarket | icing | cake | cook | heat | stir | cup | sulfur | sugar | butter | inch,"Tangy and delicious. Beautiful bright color. A wonderful alternative to the insipid supermarket apricots.  Tart dried apricots are so hard to find and absolutely necessary for some of my favorite recipes.  I particularly like this icing for a yellow cake: COOK over medium heat, stirring CONSTANTLY , for 3 minutes:
  2/3  cup dried apricots, cooked and mashed (tart sulfur cured apricots are best) -
  2/3  cup light brown sugar -
  2 Tbsp butter

  2/3 cup flaked coconut

I had to clean the marker tip every now and then and after that it won't write anymore. Now i store it away, hopefully next time the tip will be wet and able to write again.

tea | drink | morning | spice | bag | home | company | image | change | stuff | wave | design | box | line | product | customer | reformulation | labeling | version | grocery | difference | formulation | blander | variety,"I contacted Starbucks and they swear they haven't changed this tea, but they have. I have been drinking it every morning for years and I know it is different; a much weaker tea with less spice.

To prove it to myself,  I compared a bag of new to what I had at home. The bags are simply not as full. They are also bleached stark white (!) and I don't understand how a company that promotes an organic image could think that to be a change for the better.

I stocked up on the good stuff but I won't buy the new. The new tea has a green swirly/wave design on the box. It was tan before. I only mention this because it might help someone distinguish between the two types.

Bottom line, Starbucks ruined a great product and lost a customer with this reformulation.

Update: Tazo has now repackaged this tea as Tazo Chai Classic and dispensed with the green labeling and bleached bags. You can buy it in either an organic version (usually found in grocery stores) or non-organic version (I have only seen this at Target), but it doesn't make a difference; I had hoped they would have returned to the original formulation but this is still the weaker, blander variety.",I recently received a Tea drink from Whole Foods and this is the only non-alcoholic beverage that I have found that doesn't have any spice in it.

review | product | supplier | batch | fact | taste | expert | sit | order | time | quality | control | lack | fairness | almond | rest | handful,"I wrote a previous review on this product, and I was pretty well satisfied with these almonds and the supplier. However, this particular batch was awful. In fact it was so bad, it was the exact opposite of my previous review in which the almonds from this supplier were fresh and tasty. So I re-ordered from the same supplier. This batch of almonds were old with little or no taste. Some were so old, they looked like they had decayed and had a bad taste. I am no almond expert, but I do know if the product tastes fresh or not, and this particular batch was anything but fresh. It was like these almonds had been sitting around for years before being shipped, so I won't be ordering from this supplier any time soon. The quality control is lacking. In fairness, every once in a while, I would luck out and find a single and somewhat acceptable almond, but then the rest of the handful would turn on me!! I wish the supplier would have more quality control.","I was really disappointed that Avon discontinued this product because it's one of the few companies that actually makes such a great product.

mind | tea | favorite | blend | include | tin | way | foil | liner | bergamot | citrusy | depend | water | time | bit | taste | bitterness | scent | summary | quality,"This isn't quite what I had in mind for my Earl Grey, but this is an excellently crafted tea. For those who like delicate teas, this might become your favorite. The tea is a blend including Ceylon Silver Tips, a very expensive tea that is quite light and aromatic. You can see these when you open the tin, which by the way has no foil liner--the tea is just packed right into the can.

The bergamot is light and citrusy, not heavy and perfumed. The tea brews up light golden to red depending on how strong you made it; I used 2 full cups (450ml) of water and 3 small tea measures and brewed five minutes (recommended time.) It came out a medium red and a bit weaker than I like. The taste was sweet, no bitterness and a light bergamot scent.

Summary: if you like mild, delicate Earl Grey, this will be just what you want. I happen to prefer a bit more robust tea myself, but there is no doubt this is a high quality, very refined tea.","I always had a favorite blend of fresh and unusual herbs, spices and herbs, but this was not always the case with this.

I loved the result. I think I do like my chili a little more tomato-y than some people, so you might be just fine w/o the addition of the paste. It was a little spicier than I ususally like, but not over the top, still very good. I served in a bowl with a piece of cornbread on top.

MSG INDUCES OBESITY:

MSG is actually injected into laboratory rats to induce obesity.  There are many many scientific studies done using these MSG treated rats since rats are not naturally overweight.  It also has been shown to increase appetite in male rats and to induce obesity in female rats and chickens.  Scientists in Spain have recently concluded that MSG when given to mice increase appetite by as much as 40%.

CANCER: MSG AND CANCER

There is evidence that suggests that MSG produced by any method causes or exacerbates cancer(1).  At the same time, there is undeniable evidence that MSG manufactured using acid hydrolysis  always contains carcinogenic mono and dichloro propanols(2-5) and that MSG produced when a Maillard reaction occurs, always contains carcinogenic heterocyclic amines(6).

THE BACKGROUND

Truly natural glutamic acid -- as it exists in its unadulterated form in nature -- is an acidic amino acid.  It is found in abundance in both plant and animal protein where it is bound (tied) to other amino acids in chains.  Manufactured glutamic acid (MSG) is different.  It is produced commercially in manufacturing and/or chemical plants, and/or by fermentation.

All processed free glutamic acid (MSG) - no matter how produced -- is neurotoxic (it eliminates brain cells) and is endocrine disrupting (damages the endocrine system) (7-8).  In addition, all processed free glutamic acid (MSG) will cause adverse reactions ranging from feelings of mild discomfort or simple skin rash to such things as irritable bowel, asthma, migraine headache, mood swings, heart irregularities, asthma, seizures, and depression when the amount of MSG ingested exceeds a person's MSG-tolerance level(9).

All processed free glutamic acid (MSG), no matter how produced, is accompanied by unwanted by-products of production referred to as impurities.  Impurities are invariably produced by all methods used for breaking down protein (autolysis, enzymolysis, and acid hydrolysis)(2,6,10-15); by all methods used to produce monosodium glutamate; and by all methods use to produce reaction or processed flavors(6,10).  Only the impurities associated with the MSG produced by acid hydrolysis and the Maillard reaction include cancer-causing substances.

How do we know what we know?  We know from the paper Regulatory status of maillard reactions flavors that Lawrence Lin presented in August 1992 at a meeting of the American Chemical Society(10).  We know from the National Toxicology Program (NTP) of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Review of Toxicological Literature(4).  And we know from the Codex Alimentarius Commission Position Paper on Chloropropanols(5).

First time I read about this online I decided to try it out. I stopped by my local Publix and checked to see if they have any in stock. They have most of the flavours here except for a few and some (6?) pack boxes of certain flavours. They're $.79 each, not including tax of course. I bought quite a couple, I think 6. I'll try to dig up the wrappers and see which flavour, but the chocolate peppermint blew me away!
The others has a slight vitamin taste which doesn't bother me, but I just love peppermint. It tastes fantastic, each bite gives you the sweet minty taste with a bit of chocolate taste. I could gobble mine down in a few seconds and it's easy to chew which helps my teeth. Probably one of the best tasting out of the Luna and Cliff bars.

ground | flaxseed | health | heart | tablespoon | plant | antioxidant | fiber | reason | product | tbsp | morning | evening | frequency | juice | life | cocktail | recipe | drink,"Ground flaxseed is recommended by Dr. Oz, WebMD, MayClinic, and other health experts. Flaxseed is packed with Omega-3 essential fatty acids, ""good"" fats that have been shown to have heart-healthy effects. Each tablespoon of ground flaxseed contains about 1.8 grams of plant omega-3s. It also has Lignans, which have both plant estrogen and antioxidant qualities. Flaxseed contains 75- 800 times more lignans than other plant foods.  Also, it is loaded with both soluuble and insoluble fiber. This is the main reason I started using this product.  I found that once I started using 1 tbsp. in the morning and 1 tbsp. in the evening, the frequency of eliminations improved by 50%. I mix a tbsp. in unsweetened cranberry juice, per Anne Louis Gittlemans ""long-life-cocktail"" recipe.  Also, I notice that Jillian Michaels from the Biggest Loser, also recommends flaxseeds in a cranberry drink as well. If you do this, be sure to use unsweetened cranberry juice.","I have never had a flaxseed before. But there are too few of them to be of any real help as a health product.

review | sauce | kind | flea | market | ghost | pepper | intensity | burn | condiment | bottle | consistency | tomato | paste | texture | ingredient | extract | give | elude | extraction | process | get | add | spice | food | miss | taste | flavor | lot | shame | bhut | fruity | level | woman | salsa | ground | mind,"I will preface this review with a little about myself. I only recently bought a ""hottest sauce"" while at a kind of flea market in England. It was also a ghost pepper sauce and i was shocked at the intensity of the burn. At first I was sort of proud of myself for being able to use it, but it did grow on me and I started using it as an actual condiment.  After the bottle ran out I thought I would see what was on Amazon and this sauce was ranked very highly so I bought it. So I really only have one other sauce to compare this to but here goes:

The sauce is very hot. Almost too hot. It has a pasty consistency, almost exactly like tomato paste. Very finely ground. It has a more gummy consistency to it, like theres something added to it to give it a smoother texture though there's no such actual ingredient.

What there is, however, as someone else pointed out, is pepper extract. It's the second listed ingredient so there must be a considerable amount. Perhaps it's what's giving this sauce that slimy texture I was eluding to earlier. This Pepper Extract doesn't state what KIND of pepper, and as it's an extract I imagine it must have gone through quite the extraction process.

So what I'm getting at is this: the sauce feels more like a pepper extract, something which you should add small amounts of to large dishes for adding pure spice to the food. But it's missing the taste and feel of an actual hot sauce. There's little flavor, just a lot of burn. And I have to say that that's a big shame because the bhut jolokia pepper is very tasty. Almost fruity if I remember correctly.

So I give this hot sauce 4 stars for the Effort and the level of spice, but I won't give it 5 stars because I think that goes to the generic bhut jolokia ghost pepper sauces with all the scary names and pictures on the bottle. The one I had was Fear Hot Sauce with a scary ghost woman on it, and it was much more like salsa, with little ground up pieces of ghost peppers and seeds in it and equal to, if not more burn than this one.

If I change my mind as I go through this bottle, I'll update or comment on here again.",I was really sad when this sauce came out on the market. I was just about to buy some of the other stuff I saw on the market. I had never had a single pepper in my head. Now that I have a different

I love Amazon so I hate it when Amazon is the worst possible place to buy a product, but there it is.

I will look around for other sources because this stuff is AWESOME.  It has more fire than the relatively wimpy chili oils in the ethnic sections of mainstream US grocery stores, but you can control the burn factor by choosing how much to use in your recipe or as a condiment.

These sumptuous black teas provide the perfect complement to the strong bergamot essence in this blend.

Earl Grey is considered to be the second most popular tea in the world. Traditionally Earl Grey is created from a blend of black teas, usually Chinese and Indian teas, sometimes with a smoky flavor, and scented with the citrus fruit bergamot. Earl Grey tea has an interesting history. Legend has it that the first tea scented with bergamot oil was presented to Lord Grey from a Chinese mandarin whose son was saved from drowning by one of Lord Grey's men.

OILS: Rancid is a process of mother nature and has nothing to do with organic, conventional, GMO or the type of seed since rancid has to do with oil. It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.

FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.

MINERALS: Flax is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, high magnesium, high potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.

FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.

OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients. Flaxseed offers more ALA than chia for $1.99 a pound not $15 a pound, 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr.","I have a close relationship with the Almond Foundation and its associates.

The sauce has a very nice flavor, unlike any other sauce I have tried.  I would say it kind of has a bit of a mustard taste with Habanero.  I did not find it too hot to eat, and my colon is still intact.  I think it has too strong of a flavor to use in recipes, but it might go well on your morning sausages or potatoes.  Definitely worth a try, but not in my top ten hot sauces.  Update:  I tried this on Morningstar Veggie Patties (e.g. vegetarian breakfast sausage) and it is fantastic for breakfast!","I recently had this amazingsauce from Whole Foods and this microwave is every bit as yummy!

tea | buy | year | drink | order | trick | brew | gallon | glass | pitcher | spout | pot | water | fridge | tap | look | add | lemon | juice | sugar | system | dispenser | taller | room | raspberry | peach | bit | second | enjoy,"Yummy tea. We started buying these bulk deals on celestial seasonings iced black tea about a year ago when we decided to stop drinking sodas and drink something more healthy. This tea is really tasty and one order lasts us practically forever. The trick is to actually boil the bags anyway. If you do, it makes much more/stronger tea than regular non-cold brew iced tea. We bought a 5 gallon glass pitcher with a spout. We boil six bags of tea in a one gallon pot, then we dump that pot into the 5 gallon pitcher with four gallons of water in it. Since this is black cool brew tea that we boiled, 6 bags makes five gallons of tea for us. The pitcher fits neatly in the fridge, and so we have strong, cold flavored tea on tap for very little. When we are looking to do something fancy, we make Arnold Palmers with the tea by adding lemon juice and sugar. We got a nice little system down, you should try it. Make sure you measure wherever you plan to put the glass pitcher/dispenser in your fridge and you buy one that fits. Taller is better as the tea comes out easier and it takes less room. We have tried both the raspberry and peach flavors. We like the raspberry a little bit better, but the peach is a close second. Enjoy!","I'm a big Tea fan.

Remember, it's a MIST, which means it sprays LIGHTLY, so keep that in mind when you want to add just a tint of color to your party foods. For example, it's a great mist for popcorn. I sprayed some of the Kettle Korn green and added regular colored Kettle Korn for a party mix, then added green M&Ms for a sweet and savory mix. The kids loved it. You could use Color Mist to spray marshmallows, white bread, potato chips and any other lightly colored foods to keep with your party theme colors.

cafe | flavour | bit | cry | chai | addicting | drawback | powder | inclusion | creamer | mix | product | milk | stuff | version | market | water,"I discovered Tiger Chai a few years back at a little cafe, and have been enamoured with it's flavour ever since.  It's a bit of a far cry from either homemade chai or the more common instant ones (Morning Glory or Oregon), but it's really quite addicting.  I have to be careful not to drink more than 2 or 3 cups once I get started!

The only drawback with this powder is the inclusion of the nasty, super-processed instant creamer.  They don't put enough of it in the mix to really make the product creamy at all - you have to still mix it with whole milk to really make it into chai.  However, you can still taste the awful artificial stuff.  It would be so nice to get a version without the instant creamer - you could add some milk and this would qualify for being hands-down the best instant chai on the market.

Mixed with milk, it's still very good, but I don't recommend using just hot water.","I like that Cafe has an Arabic flavour, but I find that it's more of a chai flavour, which makes me feel very close to China. However, it's not exactly the same as the Chinese ca"

sugar | treat | come | speak | head | tongue | mouth | today | delight | bar | bowl | cube | touch | pestle | lot | grinding | stirring | patience | time | hour | news | tea | coffee | addition | box | bag | moisture | use,"La Perruche irregular sugar lumps are a real treat!  And this is coming from someone who generally speaking, doesn't care for anything sweet.  Maybe it's in my head (after all; refined sugar is refined sugar, right?...) but I swear this tastes different than dominoes sugar.  It's lighter on the tongue and not so cloyingly sweet.  I just popped one in my mouth earlier today to enjoy - what a delight!

Anyways; I just set up a small bar and wanted a fancy sugar to keep in my equally fancy sugar bowl.  Old Fashioned's are a favorite here, and as much as I love this sugar, I have to disagree with the other reviews about this being perfect for cocktails/cold drinks.  The cube itself will soak up bitters and will crush easy enough under the light touch of a pestle but these cubes are made of large coarse sugar crystals.  They do not dissolve easily or quickly (it's hard to say they managed to dissolve at all) in cold liquids; even with a lot of additional pestle grinding, aggressive stirring, and patience/time (about an hour).

The good news is, I enjoy hot tea and coffee frequently, and these little lovelies will be a welcome addition to both.  Love the cute box that the sugar cubes arrived in but I wish the inner bag was resealable to help keep out moisture (though I doubt they'll last long enough to have to worry about that).  Will definitely purchase again, but not for use at the bar.","I recently had this wonderful snack from Whole Foods and this little bowl of sweets is like a mouthwash.

To my astonishment, it began to smell very bad after only a few hours, and eventually degraded into a hard, wrinkly lump of brittle rabbit flesh.  Totally unsuitable for cuddling.

orbit | gum | pack | abundance | have | membership | quantity | packaging | deal,I like orbit gum and it is vegetarian friendly. This bulk pack gives me an abundance and keeps me from having to buy a Costco membership. Even Walmart doesn't carry this quantity packaging so it's a good deal.,"I am an avid orbit gum fan.

It was utterly delicious.

The cubes aren't truly cube-shaped, but they look lovely in a sugar dish for company, and they dissolve beautifully in any hot liquid.

These are now on my buy list.

Elegant, refined, and delicious!","I recently had a very good comparison with other companies that I've tried too, including Sally's, which is a nice, natural product. I like that it has a higher complexity than most of the heavily perfumed"

It has a tangy flavor unlike any other mayo I ever tasted.  It's creamy and doesn't taste heavy or oily.

I love the squeeze bottle, the larger size has a star tip when the red cap is removed or mayo can be squeezed out through a small hole by lifting up the top of the red cap.

We use it in potato and macaroni salad and mixed with soya sauce and wasabi when eating fish.

My husband read the ingredients on the package and it doesn't say it contains MSG, but we don't know if all ingredients are listed.

We use it in moderation once or twice a week so the amounts of sodium and MSG are not an issue for us.",I recently had this amazing flavor from Japan and this is the perfect size. I have a star rating because this cap has holes in it that make it easy to hold. I also love that it comes packaged with a soya sauce

But with this, I can easily have tea on the go.

I ALWAYS RECOMMEND BIOTENE CHEWING GUM FOR THESE PATIENTS.  Biotene is a biocompatible gum that has natural salivary enzymes that help remove plaque from the teeth.  Gum chewing also stimulates saliva release and any natural saliva that can be produced is of benefit.

This is a great product for those with dry mouths and I highly recommend it.

I admit at first I found the flavor a little unusual, but I've come to love it and the flavoring is all quite natural which is nice. Just various fruits and whatnot. The big thing for me was the no caffeine though. I love iced tea but brewing pitchers of iced tea every day and then waiting for them to cool was a hassle so it was great when cool brew tea first came out back in the day, however, drinking a full pitcher every day( which I often do) could be an issue with all the caffeine, so finding this decaf flavor was perfect.","I've been using this stuff for about 1 week, and the only issue is that it doesn't give me any real flavor.

My wife has been in fits for the last hour observing my reaction to a tiny amount.  There was no fruitiness as described.  The fire spread from my tongue to my ears.  One drop in a pot of chili might give you the desired kick.  I didn't knock it down as it is truly a ""hot"" sauce.  This is fire in a bottle.  Use carefully.

My wife documented my reaction to this sauce for our friends.  Her notes follow:

My husband brought a chemical weapon into the house tonight. It is called Dave's Ghost Pepper. He had waited with rapt anticipation to receive this fruity delight. It sat on the counter in the kitchen beckoning with fiery promise. I'll just try a drop he called to me.
Silence... he appeared at the door with a bemused, lost look, not quite sure where he was. His eyes were glazed, slightly crossed. The mouth moved but no sound came out, then with a whoosh of air he looked at me with tears in his eyes and in a whisper said, wow. His tongue had begun to loll out of his mouth at this point obviously trying to escape the inferno he had ignited. Drink some milk I told him. He looked at me with blank eyes. When he finally managed to make it to the fridge he swallowed the milk, his tongue still feebly falling out of his mouth. My ears feel funny he said in a quiet voice. I noticed that they were twitching a bit.

By this time I was absolutely no use to him as I writhed in silent mirth. Would you like to try some he asked which sent me into paroxysms of uncontrollable hilarity.","I have been using this for over 30 years and this is the only chemical weapon I have found that doesn't cause problems.

And while you're salivating and chomping it around in your mouth, I am NOT kidding, 20 seconds later, the flavor is sucked dry and your left with a wad of flavorless gum in your mouth.

Like seriously orbit, I know your other mint flavors last more than this! This is one of the gums which I have experienced that loses its flavor almost instantly!

If you think that the whole flax seed is better for you then think again.  It passes through the human system whole without digesting.  That's why the ground flax seed is the better way to go.  And since I'm eating flax seed, I decided that organic is the only way to go.  Spectrum Essential Organic is always fresh and good quality.",I started eating whole wheat flour this year and noticed a difference. Only about 1/10 of the kernel pieces are left in this country. I no longer have access to it. I do not have a strong omega-3 fatty system.

lot | milk | fridge | snack | acid | water | soak | blender | nut | bag | cheese | cloth | meal | flour | oven | baking | sheet | temperature,We made a lot of delicious almond milk with these and kept some in the fridge for snacking.  We soaked them for 12 hours  before using them for the milk  and snacking  and that made them softer and released the phytic acid which made them easier to digest and you could see it in the water that we covered them with  because it turned brown  and then we rinsed them off after soaking them.  Almond milk was easy to make.  We just put them in the Nutribullet or you could use a blender and add 4 times as much water and blend then use a nut milk bag or cheese cloth to strain the almond milk out and then you can drink the milk and use the almond meal for flour if you put it in the oven on a baking sheet at a lower temperature.,"I have used a lot of milk from my local supermarkets and I haven't had any problems with it.

Try it and you will never purchase regular store-bought extract again. Apparently, a cold extraction process slowly draws the delicate flavor from the vanilla beans. Vanilla extract is made by macerating vanilla beans in a mixture of alcohol and water. When purchasing a bottle, avoid the artificial versions as they they tend to have a weaker, often tinny aftertaste. Splurge for the real stuff here....worth every penny.

""Bourbon"" gourmet beans, from Madagascar and the nearby islands, have the best reputation for quality and flavor... and to my mind, after experimenting, this extract is the best - rich and creamy. The Mexican vanilla extract is stronger and it would be my 2nd choice. I buy this from Nielsen-Massey also.

Nielsen-Massey vanillas has been in business for almost 100 years. They produce some of the finest vanilla extracts you can buy. The company offers a selection of Madagascar Bourbon, Tahitian & Mexican vanilla extracts and they are 100% Organic. I have tried all three and prefer Bourbon"" gourmet beans, from Madagascar, which have the best reputation for quality and flavor, but everyone has his/own preference. I was lucky, a friend gave me a mini gift pack of all three so I could taste the difference.

The jerky is too salty otherwise.  I always keep the finished jerky in the fridge anyway, so I don't need as much salt in mine.",I recently had this amazing Flavor in my Ground beef.

The Bergamot flavor is lovely, but the black tea tastes ""off"" to me.  I know this is subjective to ""my tastes"".  I have tried the Twinings and found the bergamot flavoring to be more lemony than anything else.  The Taylor's of Harrogate Earl Grey has an exquisite bergamot flavor, but the black tea is very weak.  Alas!

Every day, a few cups at least. Normally however, all I drink is straight black tea. I find I like the IDEA of flavored teas but they rarely live up to the scent they have. This one however is a great exception to the rule. I've been drinking it for years but can no longer find it any stores near me so I was thrilled to find it in Amazon. This has become my bedtime cup. I love that it's decaf yet doesn't have that strange decaf flavor (the same one that coffee drinkers say decaf coffee has). It has a wonderful spicy/coconutty (yes, that is now a word :-P ) scent and the flavor matches the smell. There is no ""bite"" to this which some Chai blends can have. The spices are there but not all ""in your face"". The coconut flavor is mild but definitely present. My favorite way to drink this is with a splash (ok, a big splash) of Coffee Mate Coconut Creamer. It brings out the flavor and has the side benefit of bringing the tea down to immediate drinking temp lol. All in all, this is a very soothing, very comforting tea, great to wind down with at the end of the day.",I like Tea and Bare Minerals as well. They seem to be pretty similar.

First, let me say that this is delicious black tea. I have never tasted a better black tea. I will add that the slight flavor of oranges is also very good. However, I believe the product is mislabeled or something, as I could detect no bergamot flavor whatsoever. Bergamot oil is what's added to regular tea to give it the flavor Earl Grey is noted for. I have worked with pure bergamot oil and have had a number of brands of Earl Gray. Bigelow is the best I've found for pure bergamot flavor and aroma.

As Earl Gray, this tea just doesn't measure up. However, because I enjoyed the tea so much anyway, I've decided to rate it as ""excellent"" black tea with the subtle but distinct flavor of oranges. I would add this to my grocery list of they still made it.","I was really sad when Amazon started selling this product because I couldn't find it anywhere near my home.

flavor | tea | way | tasting | artificial | taste | lotus | caffeine | company | motto | tazo | web | site | type | focus | check | wording | vague | paper | packet | radiance | essence | profile | flowery | overripe | melon | blend | light | aroma | fruit | writing | limit | assume | rest | miss | premium,"****

Tazo's Lotus Decaffeinated Green Tea is one of my favorite Tazo teas. The lotus flower flavor is pleasant and delightful. This tea is not bitter or harsh in any way. It is one of the most natural-tasting of the Tazo's I've tasted, very subtle, and much less artificial-tasting.

The ingredients in Lotus are: naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Of course, this tea is caffeine-free.

Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.

On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""delightfully subtle green tea with the inner radiance and essence of lotus flower."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Lotus as ""peach, nutty, flowery, overripe melon. This surprisingly full-flavored yet delicately floral blend is clean and light-bodied, with an aroma reminiscent of freesia."" Tazo also describes the aroma as ""tropical fruit, green tea"". Hmmm...I don't taste all of these various flavors, and I suspect that Tazo really pushes the creative writing limit. I taste green tea, and a nice flowery flavor, which I'm assuming is the lotus, but not the rest---the peach, nuts, melon, freesia, tropical fruit---they're missing from what I can discern here.

I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Lotus gets only four stars.

****","I like this tazo flavor. It is very light and refreshing, just like the others. I usually use it in conjunction with other companies that I patronize or sponsor. I have a lot of caffeine but this is what I like"

vanilla | extract | flavor | quality | product | company | processing | world | country | cut | taint | profit | grandmother | girl | imitation | life | bake | scratch,"Amazing, my favorite vanilla extract. Delicious flavor. A high quality product. Madagascar vanilla beans are manufactured into extract at two locations: USA and The Netherlands.

Nelsen-Massey is a trusted company with safe processing. There is nothing like real high quality vanilla extract and I won't risk using products made in a third world country who may be cutting or tainting the product to make a higher profit.

I was told by my grandmother when I was just a little girl to never skimp and use imitation vanilla extract. Life is too short and when you're baking from scratch you will never be disappointed with high quality ingredients.

I was excited to try them as I have been bombarded with their ads for the last 2 years and I was ready to test them out.  I went on-line and looked at their packages and was so looking forward to receiving my package of fine foods and cook them.  I made my choice and fell for some of the last min. add-ons, by choice.  I went to pay and use the gift cards and well you can only use one at a time, having 2 for $15.00 I naturally thought I was getting $30.00 off the total.  With that said I was still willing to go ahead with the order.  $129.00 later I had ordered one of the package deals and the add-ons.  I received my order ups in 5-7 days packaged in a styro cooler.  packaged in the cooler were several cardboard boxes with vacuumed packaged tiny steaks.  I am a person who loves to grill and do so about 4 nights a week, so I know a little about meat, and how to cook it.  First this is not high end Dry-aged meat or wet aged this is inferior to quality meat that can be bought at a good butcher.  The steaks are about $30.00 a pound after shipping and the high prices.  The Hamburgers are tiny frozen pucks that are dry.  I am so disappointed in the quantity and quality, I really have no words to describe how disappointed I am with this whole deal.  To top everything off I received a e-mail coupon for $20.00 off my next order so the coupon that I purchased was $5.00 more than on-line deals.  Wow Do yourself a favor and spend your money in a good butcher shop of grocery store!!!","I'm looking for a school that will accommodate all your needs. When I order a meat slice, I usually leave it on the grill or in a styro box, which is nice for the kids."

It was a few dollars more expensive but I love having coffee at Starbucks cafes, so I figured it might be worth it. First, it is ground so coarsely that I must grind it some more in order to use it in my home espresso machine.

The gum was hard from the start, and I don't know if this is because it's too old or what. I don't mean like rock hard, but it's just too tough. The flavor lasts for maybe 10-15 minutes or so, so not great on that end either. It's just OK.","I like that Cinnamon has a flavor that is less than what the others have been describing.

If I want Lipton tea, I'll buy Lipton tea; it's a lot cheaper than Tazo.

I know that many people found the old blend to be too bitter. Tazo apparently decided that they'd gain more customers than they'd lose if they toned down the flavor.

Every so often, I try to ramp up. A year ago, I tried my first habanero pepper. Boy, did that set a standard! Forget jalapenos and so on. Then, as I read further about hot peppers, I came across references to ghost pepper. Habaneros are hot; we grew some habaneros in our garden this past year. As you parse them into dishes in a sensible manner, you get heat and they also support flavor.

Oh, boy! A nice heat. After finishing my dish, there was a light burn on my lips and at the back of my mouth. The sauce did not obscure the taste of the dish, but actually added an additional element. In addition, my forehead was moist from perspiration and my nose started running. But a small price to pay!

mayonnaise | bottle | time | make | dynamite | sauce | taste | style | product | packaging | squeeze | cellophane | bag | picture | anybody | access | refrigerator | bonus | cap | rosette | tip | occasion,"I purchase this mayonnaise regularly, usually more than one bottle at a time. I use it for making Japanese dynamite sauce, although it is very nice in sandwiches as well. This mayonnaise has a flat taste to it, and is not at all sweetened like American-style mayonnaise.

The product is tops but the packaging is a little odd. The mayonnaise itself comes in a squeeze bottle, and the squeeze bottle is packaged in the red-printed cellophane bag you see in the picture. Well, when you remove the bottle from the cellophane bag, you are left with a plain bottle, with no markings on it whatsoever. You will know what is in the squeeze bottle, but others won't, so you just need to communicate that to anybody that has access to your refrigerator.

A nice little bonus is that the cap on the squeeze bottle has a rosette tip, so you can make fancy little mayonnaise decorations straight out of the bottle if the occasion arises.",I love Mayonnaise. It's really unique. I used it for a while and it still smells dynamite. It's no longer available to me. I also bought a bottle for the first time and

This had great reviews and a decent price so of course I gave it a try. I've only used it once, but it was MEGA-salty. Now, I'm a person who puts salt on bacon. It's actually rare that I think something is too salty. I also made it with boxed chicken broth so maybe that added salt put it over the top?

seaweed | source | skin | hair | wakame | kind | kelp | soup | lot | bag | bill | brand | year | text | texture | pair | salad | water | style | dressing | choice | imitation | crab | leg | mayo | bedding | rehydrate,"As you may have read, seaweed is a good source of nutrients, and has benefits for your skin and hair. Wakame is a kind of kelp (Undaria pinnatifida) and is most commonly found in miso soup and Japanese salads.

If you use wakame a lot, this bag will fit your bill. I've been using this brand for years because it's big and one bag usually lasts me a year or more. Text and texture is comparable to wakame brands I've had in Japan.

There is more than enough dried seaweed here for 50+ bowls of miso soup. Just snip off a few bits of seaweed directly into the hot soup with a pair of scissors and let it rehydrate for a few minutes, then enjoy.

Wakame is also good as a salad. Rehydrate in water for 4-5 minutes, then drain and cut into desired lengths. Add some julienned cucumber, daikon, carrots, and sesame seeds and you have a simple Japanese seaweed salad. Top with a Japanese-style dressing or any of salad dressing of your choice. You can also add some imitation crab leg pieces and mayo, or use the wakame as a bedding for other foods.

Wakame should be eaten shortly after rehydrating, otherwise it'll lose its elastic texture and get soggy.

The benchmark all other sauces must measure up to. I'll ask myself: ""Is this sauce hotter than Dave's?"" ""Milder than Dave's?""

Dave's Original Insanity has been around for so long, is readily available, and as far as I can tell, has been consistent over the 15 or so years that I've been using it. Sure, there are hotter sauces out there - Dave's makes some, as do competitors, but this a reliable old faithful, a product you can reach for time and time again and know exactly how it's going to affect your cooking. I've seen Original Insanity in groceries that otherwise don't carry serious sauces.

Now that said, don't be a macho man and pour half the bottle in your chili. I promise you, you'll ruin it, and have wasted the sauce and the chili. The Old Original still demands respect, and this is coming from someone who doesn't break a sweat eating raw habaneros. Seriously, start with a drop, stir well, and taste. Repeat if you dare.

*** One other word of caution - this is really important (and not necessarily limited to this particular sauce) ***

When you get halfway through the bottle, this stuff starts coming out faster and faster, so be careful with your pour. Also, it stains like blood! After putting the cap back on, there's usually a little sauce left on the area between the lip/rim. I typically would grab a white hand towel to get this off, and after throwing said white hand towel in hot water laundry with bleach and drying, there remains deep, rust colored stains on the towels. So, just rinse the neck under cold water and dry with paper towels to avoid this problem.

The cookies are good sized and come in a nice variety, and they're definitely moist with a 'fresh baked' look, feel, and taste to them.  When not on sale I think they're rather expensive, but for the price I paid (25% off regular price) I think they were worth it.  My only real complaint is that the gift message was printed in small font at the bottom of the packing slip; not a single one of our kids noticed it, and we got quizzical messages from them asking if we were the ones who sent them the cookies.  A separate card or note taped to the top of the tin would have been a much better idea for the gift message.  So, if you're sending them as a gift you pretty much need to let the recipient know that you're sending them on your own as they most likely won't notice the gift message and be left wondering who sent them the cookies.",I wanted to get this cookie as part of a gift because I love the variety of colors and designs that are available.

tsp | taste | mouth | tongue | fire | bit | stomach | pain | pepper | extract | experience | go | scorpion | heat | system | thing,"I love hot sauces, and am not shy to seek them out.

I tried this one, because everyone says it's so great and so hot.

Well I tried it, about a 1/4 tsp or less, and it was one of the worst tasting sauces I've ever had.  It had a chemical and non-natural taste to it.

It was hot, that's for sure, my mouth and tongue were on fire for a little bit, which is fine, but what really hit me was my stomach.  It felt like it shot down to my stomach and I had a pain in my stomach for about 30 minutes and discomfort for about 4 hours.

From what I've read and heard from some chilliheads, it's the pepper extract that causes the stomach issues and taste.

So maybe everyone doesn't experience that, but from that experience alone, I am no longer going to consume sauces that aren't all natural.

All natural sauces taste great, some are very hot (with Scorpion peppers, etc...), but aside from he heat, are mild on my system.

To each his own, but I thought it was absolutely nasty, but HOT if that's your thing.","I like this tsp; it tastes like a good mouthpiece. Not much else I've tried. I have a tongue that's quite dry, and I find it to be a bit of a pain"

taste | testing | year | hobby | blend | sauce | flavor | pepper | vinegar | type | review | label | ingredient | water | acid | component | chipotle | salt | mistake | center | favor | tomato | sugar | person | chance | point | ketchup | bottle | opening,"I've bought and been blind taste testing over different 40 hot sauces for about a year (everyone needs a hobby).

I'm sorry to say that the Bufalo Chipotle blend is inferior to virtually every other Chipotle based hot sauce I've tried!

This sauce has little of the marvelous flavor of the Chipotle smoked pepper and the only flavor really evident is a rather harsh vinegar type taste yet it lacks a true vinegar flavor.

While I NEVER look at the ingredients when taste testing - yet now - as I write this review, I can finally look at the ingredients on the label.  The major ingredient in this sauce is water - the next major ingredient is acetic acid (a refined, chemical component of vinegar) and finally there is the chipotle pepper followed by various other ingredients (such as salt, etc).

Make no mistake - a relatively harsh vinegar type taste is up front and center and the Chipotle flavor is pretty weak.

Far better, among Chipotle based hot sauces, are either the Tabasco Chipotle Hot Sauce or the El Yucateco Chipotle Hot Sauce. Both of which are excellent and have a rich Chipotle favor and far surpass this sauce. The Tabasco has a fair amount of real vinegar added to the blend and the El Yucateco has less vinegar but some tomato and sugar has been added. Both of these sauces are really excellent yet different. Which you prefer would be based on how much vinegar you prefer in a hot sauce.

I honestly doubt that there would be 1 person in a 1,000 who would prefer the Bufalo Chipotle to either one of the above when given the chance to taste test them side by side.

PS: while this is a tiny point - this sauce is as thick as ketchup and the bottle opening is far too small","I have been using this for over 30 years and I've been using it for about 1 year now and it's been discontinued.

I grew up on Hellman's mayo, and as another review observed, you will probably prefer what you are used to.  Kewpie mayonnaise has its own distinct flavor, I can't exactly put my finger on what gives it its taste.  I want to try making some deviled eggs with it, I think it would give a nice twist on the flavor.  I also tried Duke's mayo, which is a lot like Hellman's, only with a more pronounced vinegar flavor.  I'm glad I tried both of these, I expect I will use up the Dukes, not sure about the Kewpie mayo.  It recommends using within one month after opening.  But ultimately, I think I'll end up staying with what I am used to, which is Hellman's.","I've been reading reviews about mayonnaise flavor.

Color is a nice nut brown, slightly lighter color than the other brand I purchase, but consistent and with gold flecking. Product is dry and well protected in it's packaging; no odd or slightly off aroma. I had happened to run out and needed this, so I used it immediately in my gluten free flour blend. It gave a nicer more soft nutty flavor to the flower than my previous brand. We also add it to our breakfast oatmeal and the results were the same. A soft nutty flavor, not overpowering. The grind is fine enough that there were no clumping issues in the oatmeal or flour blend. Some brands I've tried have almost an oily feel to them, this one did not, a good indication of proper processing.
The grind is fine but by no means would it dissolve in water, which is fine for the way I use it.

The heated tea is nicely turned immediately, boldly, vividly, red in color. I don't need to add much sweetener even as it's tart but its tartness gives it more taste.

The only drawbacks are its high price (compared to other teas which is why I'm always waiting for a sale on them) and having to wait to heat the water and waiting to cool it down in the refrigerator (or quickly in the freezer).  It's true as another reviewer said that it's very strong in taste after just leaving it in hot water for a few seconds so the longer you leave it in, the stronger and bitter or more tart it becomes and you could really be frugal and only need a tea bag for a half gallon to a gallon of water.  Adding ice helps dilute the taste as well as cool the tea down fast and cold, but I like my iced tea strong so i can taste its full flavor, so I try never to add ice.

It's a delight as an everyday iced tea as well as a great gift for a friend.","I love this hibiscus tea. It's a great choice for summertime. I usually leave it on my hands for 10 minutes, wash it out, leave it to air dry naturally and have no problem drinking it."

I can't say anything negative about this brand, besides (again) how much you must be willing to invest to get your hands on it. At one point this heavenly paste was under $40, now, you are lucky to get it under $80. The price has almost doubled all over the country, and believe me, I have been looking for it. I use this for cakes, buttercreams, anything I bake that requires vanilla. I only refrain from using it in chocolate cake/brownies, anything dark enough that the true beauty of the vanilla specs won't be noticed or appreciated. I use the legit Nielsen-Massey Pure Vanilla for those items. The first time I tried this brand I was hooked, and honestly it is going to take them taking it off the market to stop me from ordering it. If it ever goes back down in price, I am buying it by the case. Please, stop using that super market crap. Try it. Your customers will love you for it! Questions? Ask me :-)! Did you find this helpful? If so, please click the YES button.","I was just complaining about this cake when I tried it. It was a community brand that I love - Vanilla, for sure.

In fact there is no regulations protecting the labeling of raw...ridiculous, I know! As of a few years ago, farmers who grow almonds are required by law to treat almond with either steam, irradiation or chemically pasteurization. This applies to Organically grown almonds as well. I don't know about you, but if I am going to spend this kind of money on nuts, they sure as heck better not be covered in propylene oxide!

I'm glad to have found these almonds here on Amazon for the same price per pound I was paying at Whole Foods when I buy 4lbs at a time. However, it's really unfortunate that we must resort to buying these from overseas. Luckily these almonds are by far the best almonds I have ever had. They are much larger, a bit softer and mellower taste than what I was buying before.

leaf | clove | blend | pepper | nutmeg | flavor | caffeine | tea | morning | milk | dessert | drinker | drink | consideration | result | bag | variety | serve | cup | string | metal | staple | tag | put | list | price | box,"This is the best pre-packaged Chai I've ever found.  Sure, you can get some really amazing blends in loose leaf, but they are expensive.  The clove in this blend really blends well with the pepper and nutmeg.  The flavor is bold but smooth.  It's also very high in caffeine and makes a great tea to sip on in the morning.  If you really want to treat yourself, add some sweetened condensed milk to it.  It's so good, it's a dessert all on its own.

As a regular hot tea drinker, the economics involved in drinking prepackaged teas are an important consideration for me. As a result, I try to get 2 servings out of each tea bag whenever possible. For this variety, I can get 2 decent sized servings out of each bag though the second serving is a little diluted. It is still a good cup of tea. Celestial Seasonings tea bags do not come equipped with a string due to environmental considerations and to ensure that nothing compromises the flavor of the tea (like a metal staple on a tag).

This is a flavor worth putting on my ""Subscribe & Save"" list.  My retail price in local stores for one box of this tea is $3.59.","I like thisleaf clove blend.

The tree was healthy and the soil was still moist, if anything it had too much soil.  I took a fork and scooped out a good bit of soil so as not to have a huge mound around the trunk of the tree.

The picture shows a blue tray, but mine was brown, but for me that worked better with my office's color scheme.  I added some baby tears to the soil as a ground cover and to keep the soil wetter.

I didn't notice any leaves dropping like others have reported, in fact it's putting out little white flowers that are great.  Don't believe the reviews that are two years old, maybe the trees were poor quality back then but the one I got is great.","I love this box because it's so beautiful.

To me they are by the far best lemon, they pair well with many cocktails and foods (including salads!). They are more on the sweeter side compared to regular lemons, so don't confuse them for a ""lemon lemon"". I pop one or two slices into ginger ale and it complete changes the flavor to a more complex tropical flavor.

If you know how to use these lemons then they are great, but don't buy them thinking they tastes like a regular lemon. If you plan on substituting these from regular lemons then be sure to use HALF the amount.",I have been using this for over 50 years and the cost is pretty comparable.

For the record I've never been to anywhere in Latin America, just the States and Canada.  Anyway, it is very much worth trying at least once.  Some people describe the flavor in reviews as like bubble gum, I'd say that close but there's something else there too.  For something as ""simple"" as soda pop the flavor is very subtle.  It is VERY sweet though, not sure if my bottle uses sugar or corn syrup (the ingrediants on the bottle I got says either High Frutose Corn Syrup or Sucrose was used) but regardless, it is very sweet, probably up to the level of Jolt way back when they still used cane sugar if not more.  It's not something I'd want every day, I'd grow tired of it, but that is probably true of almost anything.  But it is a nice unique treat to try, and despite the price and shipping (It was packed very well as an aside, and shipped quickly so I don't think the shipping was overpriced considering that) I know I'll order it again when the mood hits to have this.","I like this soda pop culture.

That's a shame.  If they had received whole cookies they would have been leaving great reviews like I am.  These are rich and delicious.  I have a family cookie recipe we call ""Almond Crescents"".  They look different, but they taste almost exactly like these wonderful cookiers even though we usually use finely chopped almonds when we make then.  These have chunks of pecans in them.  They really do melt in your mouth if you let them last that long.  Very buttery tasting.  They are crumbly, but if you are careful you will get every bite and not make a mess.

For once, I haven't looked at the calories.  It's the holidays.  I don't care.

I bought my tin at Costco for a lot less than they are being sold for here.  You pay something for the convenience of mailing, but it's not worth it if they come as a can of crumbs.

My dental hygienist gave me a sample and told me of the way it promoted good dental hygiene. I loved the flavor and subsequently tried most of the Orbit gums until I settled on Wintermint.

According to a card enclosed with my sample this gum works by causing increased saliva, which in turn neutralizes acids. Another point made by the card is that the increased saliva can also help prevent early tooth damage and decay. While I am sure most chewing gums will trigger an increase in saliva, this one is sugar free.

Nutritionally a stick of this is less than five calories, contains no sodium, and only a single gram of carbs. It's sugar-free (otherwise I doubt it would have the ringing endorsements of the American Dental Association), and it leaves my mouth fresh. I typically chew a piece between meals to keep my mouth fresh and to add one more layer to my dental hygiene regimen. It's too early to tell how effective it is in the long term, but my mouth feels cleaner.","I have been using this for over 40 years and I was first introduced to it in Madera in the early 90's and for some years had them ship me the sample to the dentist who then came back to my dentist who said ""n"

cook | spice | mix | experimenter | fan | time | world | class | selection | gift | chef | family | food | onion | powder | ketchup | tongue | collection | chile | kind | crust | fish | manner | home | smoke | dish | pepper | remainder | ground | table | salt,"I'm an avid cook and spice mix experimenter, plus I've been a fan of Chef Prudhomme's delicious recipes for some time.

This is a world-class selection of spice mixes, and definitely a worthwhile gift for the chef in your family.  (Or yourself, if you like to try new flavorings on your food other than onion powder and ketchup.)

Although Prudhomme is a well-known Cajun chef, don't think that his spice mixes are designed to burn your tongue out.  The hottest of the mixes in this collection is the Blackened Redfish Magic.  It's a chile-powder kind of burn straight-on, but it also carbonizes into a delicious crust when you're cooking most any kind of fish in the Prudhomme manner.  (Note to those who might try this at home: open the windows or switch off the smoke detectors, this is a smoky dish!)

Other standouts are the Chicken Magic, which is a strong, herbal-scented spice, and the gentler, more complex Seafood Magic, which has notes of pepper and paprika among others in it.  And you won't go wrong with the remainder of the items, which rely primarily on the ground herbs and not table salt or MSG.",I recently had this amazing culinary experience. I was also a huge fan of Indian spices and this is the best - I think the best part about this culinary experience is that you get to taste some of the best Indian food in the world
coffee | stomach | bit | replacement | thunder | bill | caffeine | tea | mouth | flavor | herby | grass | jelly | drink | restaurant | string | process | stir | buy | leaf | breath,"I found that coffee makes me jittery and it also upsets my stomach a bit, so I needed a strong replacement.  Morning Thunder definitely fits the bill for me.  There's enough caffeine in it to really wake me up and since it's a tea, you don't really get nasty coffee mouth after you drink it.  For me, there aren't any side effects other than being more awake.

The flavor is very herby and grassy.  It reminds me a little of the Asian grass jelly drink.  It's not something that I would order at a restaurant, but the flavor is passable for me so I don't mind drinking it.

The leaves come in fancy pouches that don't have a string attached.  I've found that I can either let it sit for a while to get stronger or I can stir it to speed up the process.  I don't know if tea aficionados would object to stirring it, but I suspect that tea aficionados would be buying loose leaf tea anyways.

Overall, I find it to be a great replacement for coffee or any other caffeinated drink.  It definitely wakes me up and I don't get any of the side effects of drinking coffee like bad breath, the jitters or an upset stomach.","I like that Coke is not greasy, and it's OK.

warning | difference | background | label | version | variety | taste | sauce | vinegar | lot | dose | mind | view | bit | type | mistake | review,"Warning: there is a noticeable difference between the regular Valentina being reviewed here (a yellow background is used on the label) and the ""extra hot"" version (black background on the label). The so-called ""extra-hot"" variety - which I recommend - is not that much hotter than the regular version and to my taste buds is simply better.

The regular variety of Valentina hot sauce is heavily laden with vinegar. Yet, if you like a lot of vinegar in your hot sauce, you might actually prefer this one. It tastes very much like Frank's hot sauce or even the original Tabasco hot sauce (once it is diluted). But unless you like a heavy dose of vinegar, this variety is Not Recommended. But, keep in mind, that a lot of vinegar in a hot sauce is what many people are used to and thus prefer.

The ""extra hot"" variety is much better balanced in my view.  The vinegar is in the background and while this variety is a little bit hotter - it is far from being ""extra hot"".

To tell the two versions apart - the regular variety has a light yellow background on the label while the so-called ""extra hot"" version has a black background on the label. In very small type, on the ""extra hot"" variety, you will see the words ""extra hot"" but that is easy to miss. Use the label background to tell the two versions apart.

Make no mistake, the two versions of this sauce are worlds apart. The regular version has a heavy vinegar taste and the hotter version, which is not that much hotter, has less vinegar and is better balanced in my view. See my review of the ""extra hot"" variety for more comments.",I was first introduced to this website in Madera in the early 90's and for some years had them ship me the label back to make it seem more like a version of Spiked Bread.

I ordered the cookies on a Friday afternoon, December 4th 2015, and they arrived in the Los Angeles area on Wednesday December 9, 2015, having shipped on Monday. The box arrived well packed so that the tin, and it's cookies, were not damaged en route. Had these cookies been for me, I would not have minded a little bouncing around, dented tin and broken cookies, but not as a surprise for Mom that needed a good surprise. I feel confident from that experience that you can feel assured they will arrive fresh and intact with less potential to be a gift you have to apologize for.

My mom is not a baker but she has a sweet tooth and very much enjoys cookies, like most of us. She was much pleased with the variety, while her favorite was the classic American chocolate chip cookies, she ate them all and did not feel the need, or want, to share with anyone. The cookeis are soft with some chew without being cakey or chemically soft that you find in packaged grocery store ""soft"" batches of cookies.

The cookies don't have a pronounced buttery flavor, as they are made without dairy with palm, soy and olive oil, but they do taste rich without a greasy shortening taste. I love real butter but this is a close second, mainly just because I felt I should check it out food the foodie factor, the palm and olive oil jazzing it up over standard formulations of soy and/or cottonseed oils most typically seen. The palm oil is great for stability in hot climates, so this will be a plus for shipping in hot weather.

Overall, I'm very pleased with this order, and it went smoothly, I can recommend ordering from this experience, and I likely will, as Mom has requested more, ""If you get the chance."" Things to keep in mind, the 1lb size is best for one or two people, an office, group or family would do best with a larger size to make sure that everyone has a chance to enjoy them.

While they were there they got to sample a local taste sensation known as a ""kringle"". It was all they could talk about when they returned home. Kringles are butter-layered Danish pastries that were first introduced to Racine in the late 1800s by immigrant Danish bakers and actually date back to the 13th century. And let me tell you they just melt in your mouth. Kringles are big business in Wisconsin's fifth largest city and several bakeries ship these tasty treats to loyal fans all across America and beyond. O & H Danish Bakery has been making Kringles since way back in 1949. In this particular offer buyers get to sample a pair of O & H's most popular flavors....pecan and raspberry.

Each Kringle serves 8 to 12 people and my experience has been that they freeze quite well. Just a couple of weeks ago I sent a co-worker a Kringle to express my sincere thanks for a profound act of kindness. She loved it! Meanwhile, I showed up to Christmas dinner last year with a Raspberry Kringle under tow. Everyone enjoyed it and remarked that it was fun to sample a regional treat from another part of the country. If you are looking for a different sort of birthday, anniversary or Christmas gift then I urge you to consider one of these O & H Danish Kringles. By the way, they are also available in two packs right here on Amazon. You just might start a brand new tradition in your family. Highly recommended!","I'm 63 with still nice hair but so much less than when I was younger, before the WWII - I was still young and with the same family that I now own. Sadly, WWI stopped making this kind"

Also, I used this seasoning with ground beef in the Nesco jerky gun, and it prevented the beef from binding and caused the strips to break apart while ejecting the meat onto the rack.

Also, each pod has a handy paper ""tab"" so that you can remove it from your machine without burning your fingers.  I compared these pods to Starbucks espresso pods (regular and decaf), and the Espressione are my favorite.  Only one warning:  150 pods (individually wrapped) take up a lot of space, so be sure you know where you're going to store them.  More good news:  each box of 150 is stamped with a ""best if used by"" date, which in my case was 16 months after the date of purchase.","I like how fast an espresso can be made.

Sadly,  there don't seem to be equivalent flavors without caffeine.  Still looking, though, and I'm trying some of the other Harney & Sons decaf teas (not the flavored kind) soon and will report on these.

This tea is somewhat  light in flavor, but very pleasant, with more tea flavor and more complex than others decaf's I've tried. Kudos to Harney etc for a superior decaf tea!

They taste good with sauce or with just a little browned butter and some fresh grated parmesan.  In order to get the full, eggy richness from the noodle, make sure you salt the cooking water.  They didn't need to cook as long as most dried pasta, so check them after 5 or 6 minutes.","I love this texture because it's so rich and flavorful. You don't need much.

My latest project in a housemade lacto-fermented tomato ketchup, in which I use Lyle's Golden Syrup as the sweetener.

I don't worry about running out and tend to use a little more than a recipe calls for because I love the taste so well (and I have plenty -so why not use a little more).

Flashbang, Buttpucker, Beware, Megadeath, you name it. This blasts them all out of the water for sheer powerful heat. It will knock you down, it will punch you in the face. It can cause delirious reactions as your body reacts to heat it's never experienced before. This makes normally 'hot' sauces taste like ketchup. Even a tiny toothpick full of this will set you on fire.. First your tongue will burn, then your lips will burn, then your entire mouth will flame up and your eyes and mouth will start draining massive fluid. Then as it slides down your throat your entire throat will flame up and become infused with blow torch levels of heat. If you survive you will not likely remember much of the delirium you experienced which rivals an out of body experience.  Think I am joking? Then prove me wrong.

BUT... what I have taken to doing because I know this is so much better for me is I take a pack of this and a pack of the jell-o and I make two batches together at one time.. a double batch.  So I'm getting a little bit of the better texture and taste from the Jell-o brand but still saving a few calories.

On it's own, the Sans Sucre is passable but really bland for me the taste is sweet but not full or rounded, because it's just hard when you're palate is used to the sugary fattening stuff.  So I recommend if your palette is NOT used to anything start out on this, then you'll save yourself a lot of calories and not know the difference.","I was really disappointed that Avon discontinued this product due to a very large number of complaints about over-eating habits.

I came West from Iowa, and pork isn't in great demand out here.  The jars available are slimy globules of fat, a tiny small bit of meat sometimes, with otherwise decent juice.  I don't drink the juice, so... that left me with nothing.  Then, on an impulse, I checked Amazon.  Couldn't be, no way, but... there they were!  It has been so long.  I thought that was my favorite brand, but couldn't recall.  In hope I ordered.

A Christmas treat for a grown up gruff-bag!  Delicious.  I took both with one hand tied behind my back and in two weeks or less.  The length of time due only to as much constraint as I could muster.  It's been half a decade since I've had my favored man-treats.  Yum!

Too broke to order another set until January, but then... I'll order two per month until I am out of feasting mode and can store a year or two worth of the delectable.

I especially like it as a dieting tool:  when I have the urge to eat and I'm not really hungry, I chew some gum and that usually does the trick.

Orbit is definitely my favorite brand of gum.  I find that each piece keeps its flavor for at least an hour, and it doesn't get that dried-out, tacky feeling.  I suppose you could say that it stays moist, and doesn't really lose its texture.

I've chewed minty flavors for years, and then last year I got into the Cinnamon flavor.  All of those are great!  I ended up buying the bubblegum flavor simply because it was much less expensive, and I figured, ""why not?!""

I am really enjoying the flavor.  Bubblegum isn't a flavor I have very often.  It's sweet, too, which really satisfies my sugar tooth.  Plus, I like how when I have an open pack, my purse gets a sweet smell!

Overall, this was a great purchase.  You get two boxes, each of which has 14 pieces.  So, aside from just the sheer quantity of gum, I like that I have several layers of plastic wrap protecting the packs of gum.  Seriously.  I live in a climate that gets very hot and humid during the summer, and if my gum isn't protected, it gets all mushy and loses its flavor.  It gets ruined!  So, given that it will take me a while to use this whole thing, I'm very glad that each pack, and each box, is covered in cellophane and will last!

Overall:  I definitely recommend.  Especially with the subscribe & save pricing, you can't buy good-quality gum at a better price!  And the bubble gum flavor is a sweet little treat that reminds you of when you were a kid.","I recently got this from Hobby Lobby and this is the best gum I've ever smelled.

How do you actually review pepper?  I must not be qualified other than to say I enjoyed the product, found it at a very good price point.

Pepper is very underrated IMO.  I use it on almost everything.  French Fries, Pasta, soups and pizza.  I seldom add salt because everyone cooks with too much salt these days from my standpoint.

If you are not used to this kind of cheese you might have the same reaction I did and I guess since I am usually getting cheese that's found in the supermarket (like slices of Kraft cheese or a block of cheese) I found this cheese to be an acquired taste.  At 1st I thought the cheese was awful but than I thought about it and the main reason I thought that was since I am not used to the taste it might not be pleasing at 1st.  So I gave it a chance and over a few minutes I had found it to be great tasting and I wanted more and its the same way when someone eats it with me.  Even though when I let someone else taste this cheese they usually have the same reaction I had when I ate it the 1st time and I understand why, so I explain why it probably doesn't cater to their taste.  I have found its taste is still not for everyone so that's why I figure its more acquired if you are used to something else.  I have found any of the cheeses that came to be relatively strong tasting and always leaveing an aftertaste and that is not always a bad thing.

sauce | fan | dozen | rank | heat | level | lineup | taste | garlic | flavor | family | flavoring | food | put,"This is quite an interesting hot sauce. I'm a huge fan of Blair's hot sauces, of which there are many types - at least a dozen. They are rank-ordered by Blairs in terms of heat level and this is the 2nd mildest sauce in their lineup.

The taste is great: a very strong Jalapeno taste with hints of garlic and some other spice(s). Unlike some (many?) hot sauces, which are all heat and little or no flavor, this one is all about the strong flavor. You can really, really taste those Jalapenos, and it goes fantastically well on things that benefit from an intense Jalapeno taste - eggs, chips, etc.  This sauce is *extremely* mild, and by mild, I mean it has almost no heat. It has turned out to be the perfect sauce to offer family and friends who don't like hot foods. The heat is so mild in this sauce that it's really more of a flavoring sauce than a hot sauce. But that's OK - the flavor is superb; it stands on its own even without heat. It's just that if you want some heat, you'll have to add a real hot sauce to whatever food you're putting this on.","I am a diehard acacia fan.

way | heat | pot | chili | batch | salsa | food | flavor | pepper | tangy | style | balance | abuse | sauce | web | search | lot,"""Dave's Insanity Sauce"" is not to be taken casually or even as a way to add heat to individual servings, this is meant for larger dishes such as a whole pot of chili or a big batch of salsa since one or two drops will make a large amount of food VERY hot. That being said, this does have a really good flavor that adds a nice pepper tangy hit that complements most Mexican or South-Western dishes, but I wouldn't use it in Indian or Chinese style dishes. There are hotter sauces available, but this one is a good balance of flavor and heat.

There are several amusing and somewhat painful to watch videos of people abusing this sauce on various web sites and a quick search will provide you with a lot of hits.

Highly Recommended!

CFH",I like this fusion of heat and spice. It's really just the right amount of chili pepper in a pot. I also make sure the chili is not overly spicy. This recipe calls for a lot of chili. Yum

Decent zing; not really hallucination-worthy*, but definitely a nice, even burn from the very first bite.  Great flavor - Dave's original insanity sauce is OK for kicking it up a notch, but lacks any real depth; this sauce makes up for it and then some!  It has a far more robust and somewhat fruity flavor profile, not just ""pure white heat"".  Definitely worth every penny - this will become a permanent addition to my condiment cabinet.  :)

* Disclaimer: to be fair, I routinely eat hot peppery foods in amounts and concentrations that might cause harm to more rational folks.

*** UPDATE: ***
I had some pizza with Volcano Powder (powdered Bhut Jolokia, also ordered from Amazon) dusted all over it until it looked like cinnamon toast, and then sprinkled liberally with the Daves.  Man, oh man, what an amazing combination!!!  I'm not really a big pizza fan, but this was pretty incredible.  The Volcano Powder gave it an added smokiness, and with the fruity flavors from the Daves, it was just a glorious chorus of heat and flavor.  And I do mean heat - whoa, Nellie!!!  I didn't get quite to the snot-slinging, gasping and choking stage, but I had a pretty good forehead sweat going on before it was done, and I think my sinuses will be clear for a week!  Oh, and for the record - the next two slices I doctored up were every bit as as glorious as the first!  :-)",I'm a big fan of the smokiness that ensues after a few hours in the cabinet.

Easter is one of the most solemn and holy days on the calendar. It's a day when families come together to dress up in pastel leisure suits, clock in at church for the year, and spend the weekend celebrating that time when the Romans nailed a chocolate bunny to a cross, and it came back three days later as a bag of marshmallow peeps.

Or something. I sort of skimmed that part in Sunday School.

Anyway, it's pretty great. So I decided to stock up on Easter party supplies.

Anyone can hide plastic eggs; I thought the kids in my neighborhood deserved a REAL Easter experience. They should have an ACTUAL bunny rabbit, giving out candy and treats -- just like in the Easter cartoons.

So I bought this rabbit, thinking that 'fresh' and 'whole' were great qualities for an Easter bunny. Sadly, I didn't think about 'alive' or 'unskinned', of which this thing is neither. So my idea of training it to hand out candy sort of went out the window.

No matter. I stuffed the carcass full of Peeps and Reese's pieces, and strung it up by the legs in a tree in the yard. The kids took turns whacking at it with barbecue tongs until it all came tumbling out, like some sort of hairless Easter party pinata.

I've never seen kids cry so much while they're picking up candy. Somebody ought to teach these children the TRUE meaning of Easter.",I'm 63 with just the Easter bunny on a cross. This is a very nice holiday calendar. I usually leave it at 4 pm and come in a whack (because I can't do anything

I've had this tea alone and it misses something (in my taste preferences) and the pepper taste is strong in an unpleasant way. It mellows out if I add milk or cream.

Also, my husband kept complaining that the maple syrup I was buying at Costco just wasn't all that great.

tea | decade | aroma | taste | tazo | passion | flavor | edge | way | husband | citrus | y | balance | hibiscus | relax | day | night | water | craving | breakfast | afternoon | dinner | palate | time | verrry | teabag | get | blend | steeping | punch | bottle | course | combination | idea | brewing | convenience | week | make | requirement | stock | fridge | mug | microwave | have | life,"Tazo's Passion tea has been one of my favorite teas for a decade, and is the one that introduced me to Tazo teas in general. On the whole, Tazo teas are beautifully fragrant and flavorful teas. They are as aromatic as they are delicious. In some cases with non-Tazo blends, the alluring aroma makes promises that are unfulfilled by the taste. Tazo doesn't tease!

Passion is a very crisp, tart tea. I don't sweeten my tea, because I think the flavor loses its edge. And Passion is edgy, in a good way. It really lives up to its name. My husband says it's too citrus-y, but I think it's a good balance. The hibiscus is the dominant flavor, but the subtle notes harmonize with it.

It's a lovely, relaxing tea to read with, day or night. I drink it hot and cold. Cold, it's often more refreshing than water. Sometimes I have a craving specifically for Passion Iced Tea. Hot, it makes a beautiful breakfast tea or afternoon tea. It might even be a good dinner tea, actually, if you sip it between courses to cleanse your palate! I usually order an Earl Grey. I'll test it next time I can.

I get very experimental with my teas. Here are a few discoveries I've made with Passion, which might apply to other Tazo teas, too:

1) My Laziness and Impatience Actually Paid Off!
It can be cold-brewed verrry easily. I just take a few sips from a water bottled and stick the Passion teabag (sometimes two) inside. I shake it up after about ten minutes and it's excellent. (Works with Awake and Wild Sweet Orange, too. Zen is better hot-brewed.)

2) Getting Creative
Passion is strong, but I like it stronger, and more complex. I have added a second Tazo blend to both hot and cold steeping. Earl Grey, Wild Sweet Orange, Awake, and Zen each combine with Passion for a wonderful punch of flavors.

3) Idle Hands . . . or Clever Hands?
One day I stuck a Passion teabag in a Nalgene bottle filled with Sprite. It was AMAZING! It was carbonated sweetened tea!

4) The Obvious Next Move
So of course I went further and tried it with Coke. It was shockingly good. A flavor combination I cannot describe. It was Passion Coke. Still Need To Try: Ginger Ale, Lemonade, and Tonic Water.

5) Brew In Batches
If you don't like the idea of cold-brewing, but like the convenience of water bottles, you could try what I do once a week. I boil 4-6 quarts of water and steep as many teabags as I want, making sure to at least meet the minimum requirement. Then I pour it into the water bottles I used during the week, and my Nalgene bottle. I have a stock of ready-made tea handy in the fridge, to drink cold or pour in a mug and microwave!

I like having so much Passion in my life ;)","I've been using this for over ten years. It has been known to sulfate free, with no added chemicals. It's no longer available to me. I also love the tea bean aroma."

Nesco Original jerky marinade is superior to Nesco's Teriyaki jerky marinade.

reason | pack | mislead | cinnamint | flavor | package | taste | peppermint | breath | refresher | data | link | piece,"Misleading.  The reason this is cheaper than the other flavors is that this is a 12 pack, whereas the others are all 24 packs for around $21.  Beware of misleading listings.

Also, the cinnamint is probably the weakest flavor.  Even fresh packs (I can tell because of the dates of promotions on the package they sometimes run) can sometimes taste stale.  This is because the flavor of the cinnamint lasts just a few minutes.  Tasting all flavors, the peppermint by far outlasts this flavor and most of the others.  I highly recommend that flavor for a nice breath refresher between brushings or just after meals.

Since I use a home iced tea maker, I cut a few pouches open at a time and store in an air tight container.  You could use the whole pouch but it's a waste of tea.  I put 4 rounded teaspoons in the basket with a coffee filter.  I always use filtered water instead of tap water, and the clear cubes from the grocery are hugely better than tap water cubes although I usually end up using tap water cubes and the result is still great.

coffee | similarity | brew | aroma | redolent | ground | brewing | water | thing | result | aftertaste | palate | look | gold,"I really wanted to like this coffee, especially because I have such fond memories of the caf&eacute; itself on Decatur Street in the French Quarter of New Orleans from days gone by. But there is no similarity between the heavenly coffee I enjoyed down there and this vile brew. When I opened the can I was disappointed by the aroma, which was redolent of old socks, and the coffee itself looked like roasted, coarse-ground weeds; there were actually what could only be described as twigs in it. But I had to give it a fair go so I went through an entire can before I finally gave up on it. I tried various brewing methods and coffee-to-water ratios but one thing was consistent: No matter how I brewed it, the result was always harsh and bitter, and it left a nasty aftertaste that lingered on the palate for hours.

I also tried Community New Orleans Blend, which was less astringent but more like plain old conventional coffee. Then I discovered French Market City Roast (also available from Amazon) and I had finally found what I'd been looking for: rich, smooth chicory coffee that tastes like that ""black liquid gold"" that I remembered from the Quarter. If you want the real thing, it's the only one to buy.","I like that Coke is not really a hot commodity, and that it has a similarity to other coffee brews.

I will admit, I didn't want to dump the entire bottle in the icing and I was only making enough icing to frost 12 cupcakes (not a lot).  I did shake the bottle well prior to use and beat it well to mix it well into the icing.  I finally gave up and went with a different company and made different colors for my icing since I could not achieve the white color I was looking for.  I would not recommend this company for coloring and they do have a lot of additives in their products.  I would also not recommend this product because it could not achieve what was stated on the bottle - color my icing (white in my case).","I was excited to get this product because I didn't think it would cost more than $1 for a glass of icing.

tea | make | difference | label | problem | milk | taste | test | drink | success | rate | packaging | dust | ruin | edit,"Well I bought this tea after being in Malaysia for several months, mostly to try making teh tarik without using loose tea as we did several times.

That turned out to be wrong, the problem is the condensed milk which is clearly different in Malaysia than what I've been able to get in the U.S.

I would say the taste is marginally different than regular Lipton black tea, if you had me do a blind taste test I'm not convinced I would be able to know which I was drinking with a reliable success rate.

I ordered 4 boxes and the packaging was sealed well, but it has this unmistakable dust-like taste that is ruining the tea.

I'm also bored at work, so it gives me something to do. LOL.

I love real maple syrup, and I've tried most major brands, as well as many smaller, local brands (I live in the northeast). The taste and consistency of Coombs is perfect and in line with all high quality maple syrups. This is how the real deal tastes and feels. I prefer a deep, rich maple flavor, so I keep a bottle of dark amber on hand at all times. If I'm feeling particularly sassy, or a frigid winter morning is threatening to keep me from work, I will actually use a dark grade B syrup. Generally speaking, that's reserved for cooking, but I love the robust, often complex taste and structure. It can become a transformative experience - I imagine the old growth forest that gently watched over the land for generations before, and who will continue its watchful eye for generations yet to come, and I find myself reconnecting with something much greater than myself. It is humbling and deliciously wonderful to be brought to my knees by the enormity of it. Who knew pancakes could elicit such a deep introspection. Pippa's pancake philosophy - It could revolutionize the world! It truly baffles me that the darker ambers are considered ""sub-par"" or of generally lesser quality. But hey... that's just me, I suppose. If you want milder flavor, go for a medium amber. If you just want a sweet coating for your pancakes, go for the light amber.... and never come to the northeast. LOL - just kidding (sort of).

If you find yourself balking at the taste and/or consistency, I suspect that you are overly accustomed to the cheap crap you find in a general grocer's aisles. They add a bunch of nasty chemicals, fillers, and thickeners to their products. Or worse, as is the case with such brands as Aunt Jemima's and Mrs. Butterworths, there is ZERO actual maple syrup in the ""formula."" That is not an exaggeration. Look at the ingredient list and you will see it's basically high fructose corn syrup with a synthetic ""maple"" flavor.

It's a disservice to the Amazon rating system when people give a good product a one-star rating simply because they do not know any better - don't get me started on the troglodytes who stammer on about nonsensical bull-shite that has nothing to do with the product or its inherent quality, or lack thereof. Although, in all honesty, it's far more disconcerting that Americans have become so disconnected from their food that they react negatively when offered the real thing. But I digress - that diatribe is best saved for another time.

Overall, this syrup is some of the best around. And the price is pretty decent, esp. if you use the ""Subscribe and Save"" option. You'd be hard pressed to find a better deal in the store, and Coombs is probably the best offering here on Amazon.","I was really disappointed that Avon discontinued this product because I didn't want to risk food poisoning or over-eating.

summer | muggy | steam | pavement | living | morning | time | cafe | lait | coffee | chicory | plate | sugar | robust | flavor | answer | cichorium | intybus | var | cultivation | substitute | ground | region | plant | use | additive | beet | rye | ingredient | crisis | endive | half | milk | atmosphere,"It's summer. It's so muggy you can see the steam rise off the pavement. Yep, you're in the semi-tropics now. It's New Orleans and the living is easy. And it is 8 o'clock in the morning. Time for cafe au lait made with coffee and chicory and a plate of beignets dusted with powdered sugar. It's the chicory that gives cafe au lait its robust, mellowed down flavor.

Chicory? What is chicory? Thought you would never ask. I just happen to have that answer right here:
From Wikipedia: ""Root chicory (Cichorium intybus var. sativum) has been in cultivation in Europe as a coffee substitute. The roots are baked, ground, and used as a coffee substitute and additive, especially in the Mediterranean region (where the plant is native), although its use as a coffee additive is also very popular in India, parts of Southeast Asia and the American South, particularly in New Orleans. Chicory, with sugar beet and rye was used as an ingredient of the East German Mischkaffee (mixed coffee), introduced during the ""coffee crisis"" of 1976-9."" Chicory is also related to endive and raddichio.

Cafe au lait is strong coffee mixed half with hot milk, and sugar added as desired. There is nothing like it, especially when drunk in the atmosphere of New Orleans.","I live in a cool summer climate with little to no humidity and this is what I call the ""cool"" steam. I live in a wheelchair and almost every day, I get a chance to try it, but only a"

It had a mellow spearmint flavor.  This new stuff has the sharp almost acrid sweetness that is just like every other spearmint gum.  I don't think it's the sweetener either, because their Juicy Fruit tastes just like the old time juicy fruit.  They must have changed the 'secret recipe' for the Spearmint and they absolutely ruined it! It used to be my favorite flavor, but evidently it's gone forever. They even changed the package to be sharp looking.  The old time spearmint package was almost all white.  I won't order it again.","I recently had this amazing sweetener from India that I had never used. I had used it before, but instead of sweetener, I used this instead.

But if you appreciate a well rounded, flavorful coffee, then this is the one to try.

I lived in Hawaii for 3 years and was introduced to Kona coffee at the source.  Of all the coffees I've had in my life, Kona is my favorite.  It is the richest and smoothest you could imagine.  Others are good, but not in this class.  Also, watch out for Kona coffee blends.  They can be tasty, but are usually only 10% Kona beans and not the top crops at that.  This is the primo stuff here!

Now I am hooked. Works wonders on fish, but also terrific on potatoes, rice, eggs, chicken, steaks, Italian dishes and in all sorts of casseroles. It is a delightful medium grind blend of salt, black pepper, parsley, garlic, onion, lemon peel and green peppercorns. The mixture is a bit heavier on salt than I would like but I use it sparingly as it is quite potent on the other spices as well.

I like to mix about a third cup of spice with a cup and a half all purpose flour in a baggie which I refrigerate for at least a few days. The spice flavors the flour which I then lightly sprinkle on fish or meats before pan grilling in a couple tablespoons of olive oil in a cast iron skillet. The result is a beautifully browned, light, crunchy, low fat, flavorable crust surrounding a wonderfully moist fillet of salmon, orange roughy, tuna, chicken or even rib eye steak.

Fisherman's Wharf really kicks up homemade potato salad, scrambled eggs and homemade chicken salad. I have mixed it with mayonnaise to spread on ham, tomato and lettuce sandwiches, BLTs and leftover turkey and fresh vegetable wraps.

I would recommend to try make it as an actual Chai Tea , that is the milk tea or the tea with some milk added into it.
That is how I do my Chai:
 I heated up a mug of unsweetened vanilla almond/soya milk, froth it a bit, and then drop a tea bag in.
As with all herbal teas I like them better when sweetened, this one is no different. So I add a tiny bit of sweetener(I use agave)

This drink definitely satisfies my sweet tooth, and I recommend trying it like this to anyone, especially those who are unsatisfied with the tea's flavor when it's made with water. Great treat for a fraction of calories/

Again, I would definitely recommend this tea. 5 out of 5 and thank you, Celestial Seasonings)

I bought the same container at Walmart for $2.74!  Anyway, I bought this for a ""mommy and me"" cupcake decorating class.  I don't know why anyone would recommend this icing except for last minute ease of use if you did not have time make your own.  It is super sweet and ridiculously stiff, which serves its purpose if thats what your looking for.  However, many of the Wilson tips (a large range of sizes) that we used in class were too small to properly push the icing out without tremendous force.  I had difficulty.  It was impossible for my eight year old.  The icing seemed suited only for the 2 largest tips.  My classmates were inquiring about a more ""workable"" icing than this.  We were told to Youtube it since better icing exists.  I guess for something quick and cheap (if purchased elsewhere), it was ok.

comparison | brand | extract | paste | look | gel | substance | concern | stuff | taste | accord | label | tsp | vanilla | thickener | tragacanth | gum | tree | go | bottle | flavor | bean | ice | cream | cake | make | add | food | past | include | home,"Nothing beats Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla. Once you've used it, all other vanillas seem weak or watered down in comparison. I've been using this brand exclusively for at least 5 years now. However, I always order their Vanilla extract & didn't even realize they offered a 'paste'.

I wasn't looking closely when I ordered this and was surprised when I opened this and found it was a thicker, gel-like substance. My first concern was ""will it taste as good?"" followed by ""what is being used to thicken this stuff?"". The taste seems pretty equivalent and according to the label, a tsp. of this is equal to a tsp. of their vanilla extract. The thickener used is Gum tragacanth, which if you wiki it shows as being a gum from a middle eastern tree.

Personally, I'd prefer to cook with stuff that doesn't have added thickeners, colorings, artificial flavorings etc., so going forward I will be sure to check the label and order the extract. However, I didn't see anything about the gum tragacanth to make me want to toss this bottle out and not use it at all.

I do not think this has better or more intense flavor than the Nielsen-Massey Vanilla extract although others here have claimed this. You do see the little bits of vanilla bean in the gel/paste, so if you like that ""look"" of vanilla bean specks in your ice cream, cake or whatever you're making then this will give you that. However, taste wise, it's not better plus you're adding a tree gum to your food.

All-in-all I'll stick with the same brand vanilla extract going forward, but would be willing to order this paste again if their extract weren't available (because the taste of the Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla is far superior to every other vanilla I've used in the past (including home-made).","Comparatively, I've used almost every brand I've tried, and I've never had any issues with product liability.

I have always received this fresh.  I have never had any trouble with it.  Once I open it, I keep it well sealed in the refrigerator.  It is gone in a week or two, so it isn't sitting around in my house.

 I think it is a great source of fiber.  I need fiber because I want to live forever!  I have ulcerative colitis, and I need to keep my intestines as healthy as possible.  I eat this stuff every day in rather large quantities.  I put it in everything.  I cook with it.

I dip blueberries into it.  I cover a large plate with it and then add steamed greens and eggs and eat it for breakfast. I add it to soups, sprinkle it on salads, add it to meatloaf, cakes and cookies and brownies.  I love love love it!","I'm a big fan of Mark & Buster's Sawdust. Hed been using it for about 1 week, and I only get tired of it every week. He says the fridge keeps it nice and clean."

stuff | lack | flavor | extract | course | plenty | thing | sauce | way | manufacturer | home | sause | par | spice | dose | pepper | put | butch | rave | heat | bill | buy | bit,"I will give Dave's that this is pretty spicy stuff, but is really lacking in flavor.

As much as I love extraordinarily spicy sauces such as this, the capsaicin extract flavor is really unpleasant.

I've found that sauces that use extract are of course very spicy, but generally have a pretty awful flavor.  I've tried plenty of different brands, and I see the same thing.  Extract seems to completely ruin the flavor of the sauce.  From what I'd guess - using extract is the CHEAP way out for the manufacturer (make things hot, for cheap).  I grow several varieties of hot peppers at home, and have made batches of sause easily on-par with the spice of dave's, but they have actual flavor (really good flavor).  It just takes a healthy dose of whatever hot pepper I'm putting in (butch-t's, red savina, etc).

I knew Dave's had extract, but was sucked in by the rave reviews.

If you don't care about flavor but heat only, I guess this fits the bill.

From now on, I'm not buying any more hot sauces that have capsaicin extract.  They do exist, but are usually a bit more expensive.","I like that this stuff doesn't have much flavor. It's pure flavor, not stale, it's just too ""traditional"" with no added spice. This sauce is so delicious, and I've never had"

This month it is flour, next month medium chain fatty acids, I often wonder if folks understand the etiology of why some people simply can't eat certain foods? but I digress - The problem really is that I can't stand eggs in my food. I find them so off putting. I mean I love eggs by themselves in savory dishes but not in any desert, egg(nog) or pancake etc (yet to find away around using eggs for crme brle).

I often use applesauce as a substitute and still do but for some reason it doesn't emulsify as well. With this not only am I pleased with the nutty earthy taste but you practically can't tell the difference between this and recipes that use eggs. I made two identical chocolate orange cakes one using eggs, & the other using flax and no one could tell the difference in fact the second cake had more of an audience which I presumed was due to the mocha icing but no it was definitely the nuttiness from the flax.. it conspired to make an enchanting desert!

 I add one tablespoon of flax for an egg plus three table spoons of water and beat them together to get that viscid consistency, add the other wet ingredients to the dry ingredients et voila.
Really glad of it.. I am used to flax seed oil on fava beans and when I told my aunt about this she was quizzical as to how it can come in ground form but it does hurraahh.
I did find it much cheaper elsewhere practically half the price so I might try the other brand see what the extra dollars are all about. I am hoping they're all the same I'd rather save the extra money. But there you've it, even folks on a regular diet can enjoy this as well.","I am an avid etiologist, and I have noticed that my cholesterol levels are higher in this food, even when I'm watching it.

It cracks me up that the marketing verbiage says, ""Folks down there know two things better than most anyone how to eat and party."" I want more out of life than eating and partying but when I'm eating or partying, this Aidells Cajun Style Andouille sausage hits the spot.

This sauce is no joke. My dad tried a spoonful of it while he was working up in Alaska. Big mistake. He couldn't breathe. It nearly sent him to the hospital. I was smart enough to put some on a spoon and then dip the tip of my tongue into it, not try and eat a whole spoonful. This sauce is extremely thick and concentrated. It barely runs out of the bottle without some shaking for encouragement. It has a very bitter pepper extract flavor up-front, with a touch of smoky habanero. If you can get over the nasty bitterness, you might even be encouraged to try some more. Don't. Then, the burn hits. After tasting just a little of this, you will need milk. Like, five glasses of milk. And it's oily and the milk just spreads it around your mouth and makes the burn worse, at first. If you like spicing up your food, this is very economical; a teaspoon will make any dish almost inedibly hot for most people. One bottle will last a very, very long time. Don't be dismayed by the gross flavor; when diluted in a bowl of chili con carne, the bitterness vanishes.","I like thissauce because it's not exactly a joke, but I do like how quickly it heats up and I can even give it five stars as the joke!

One day, I wanted my husband to put my shelves up for me in my craft room (due to an unfortunate incident that shall remain unnamed, I am no longer allowed to use his drill). He did not want to do this, because it involved measuring, finding studs, and was generally boring and tedious.

After hemming and hawing over what he would like as his reward for completing the task for me, he finally brightened and said ""I want 5 pounds of redvines!"" thinking that I couldn't find any on short notice. We agreed, he would not have to do the shelves until said Redvines were in his posession, and we had a movie night scheduled.

I snuck onto Amazon, and minutes later, had this tub ordered Prime. Amazingly enough, I got an email half an hour later saying it was shipped! I had opted for 2 day shipping, but lucked out and it was to me the next day. Imagine the look on his face when I triumphantly presented him with 5.5 lbs of licorice, popcorn, and a chick flick.

The vines were not stale as they can be when buying them in the small packages from the video store, and tasted great. Plus, as an added bonus, the container is somehow dog proof.

sugar | honey | milk | cream | tea | spice | grocery | store | quantity | work | teaspoon | oz | mug | taste | brew | post | coffee | drinker,"UPDATE, 8 19 14:  No!  I have tried it iced, hot with sugar, hot with honey, with milk/cream, without milk/cream.  I don't like this tea.  I will go back to Bengal spice, I REALLY love that one, no matter how I prepare it.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I picked this up from my local grocery store because it was only $13 for the same quantity.  I like to drink Celestial Seasonings Bengal Spice Tea at work.  I use 3 bags, add 2 or 3 teaspoons of cream and 1 teaspoon of sugar for my 22oz mug.  I did the same with this and the taste was far too light, not enough spice.  I will try it in my mug without the cream and perhaps in a few days, as part of my iced tea brew then update this post.

I suggest the Bengal Spice, prepared as Chai.  It satisfies even this coffee drinker.","I purchased this from the Soupa Company in Culver City with honey in it. I then purchased it from a local grocery store. I had no idea what I was doing at the time of the brewing, so I decided"

So I haven't had that experience in a long time, no matter whether I buy the bags or loose. Has Lipton changed since I was young? (I'm talking 1960s-70's- maybe later.)

I could probably eat the tablespoon just by licking the spoon but it is very sweet and I've been off white sugar long enough that too much sweet is a horrible taste to me.  This works perfectly.  I just use the stronger stuff for my baked beans - this is perfect for ""medicinal"" purposes!

tea | blend | kind | hibiscus | peel | lemongrass | acid | fruit | juice | extract | color | bag | quart | water | plant | sugar | flavor | fruity | version | punch | drink | husband | passion | flowery | have | oomph | alternative | day | diet | quenching | city | tap | source,"Tazo Iced Passion tea is an herbal blend not a true ""tea"", since it has no black tea, no green tea, or any other kind of real tea. It is technically an herbal tea with some additional ingredients added. It has hibiscus flowers, licorice, orange peel, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass plus it as added ""natural tropical flavors"", citric acid, and fruit juice extract for the very red color.

These are ""iced tea bags"" -- each bag is large and makes 2 quarts worth of iced tea. The directions indicate to boil 1 quart of water and to steep the bag for 5 minutes then to pour into another 1 quart of cold water to make the iced tea. This was easy to do.

I like sweet iced (traditional) tea and also I enjoy herbal teas and other plant infusions. I first tried this tea with sugar added as I assumed I would want it, but then tried it unsweetened and found the flavor fruity and almost sweet naturally, so now I drink it without added sugar. I would say it tastes sweet and fruity and almost like a more sophisticated version of a fruit punch drink that kids usually like.

Everyone is different and only you can determine if this is right for you...

My husband enjoys unsweetened iced tea and hot traditional teas unsweetened and he felt this unsweetened iced passion tea was too ""sweet"" and ""flowery"". My sons didn't like it as they are used to plain water (which is 99% of what my husband and I allow them to drink) or having their flavored drinks even more dense such as pure fruit juices or artificially flavored drinks or having sugar-filled sodas. My kids have learned to associate flavored drinks with more of oomph and more sweet than this unsweetened herbal ""tea"", unfortunately.

This also has a fantastic deep red color thanks to the added fruit juice extract.

I really enjoy this as an alternative to drinking plain water all day long. It is nice to have a flavorful cold drink that has zero calories, does not have unnatural ingredients, and has no artificial sweeteners (as diet sodas have). It is quite thirst-quenching too.

Drinking Tazo Iced Passion Tea also helps mask the flavor of city tap water which is good for when I am stuck with city water as my only water source.","I am so happy that I was able to buy this stuff. I have mixed tea and water, and this is the closest thing I've ever found. I have hibiscus peel, lemongrass, and"

Look no further.  They don't mill wheat, so it's gluten-free with no chance of cross-contamination--unlike virtually every other brand of corn flour out there, except Publix, which is only available in four U.S. states.

Edit:  Masa Harina Socca

(With many thanks to Mark Bittman.)  One and 1/2 cup water to one cup masa harina--let sit for several hours, covered.  Preheat oven to 450.  Find a flat cast-iron skillet without sides--like a flat fajita grill.  (A regular cast iron pan with sides will concentrate the heat too much on the edges and burn the edges before the center gets cooked.)

On the other hand it's not for the faint of heart, LOL!!!  I've been a chef for 20 yrs., this product rates very high in all areas of flavor profiles.  The only drawback I have with it is the initial heat is so in your face hot if you are not prepared you could damage your mouth and everything you eat past that is a non-issue.  My suggestion is to just use a single drop on the first use to let the palate(roof of mouth) and the 50 or so gustatory receptor cells on our tongue to adjust, letting what I will tell you is an incredible initial shock to the mouth even for a seasoned hot sauce connoisseur settle.  My eyes watered and I got the heat hick-ups oh, wow, my forehead immediately beaded with sweat!  I thought for a minute or ten because I had tasted an entire 1/2 teaspoon I had gone to H***.  I sat down and ate about 20 soda crackers and got some relief.  I have tasted (300K Scoville) Habanero Sauce, and although great it doesn't compare 'if' you use this product correctly.  This is not a product to be used by someone who is not a seasoned hot sauce user or someone who thinks they would like to play a joke.  I was very satisfied with this product and will order it again and again.  Living south Louisiana it compliments many items which I eat.

In this case, although the flavor lasts fine, the taste is not what we expected. I'm not a big fan of mint gums, but my son usually likes them. He doesn't like this flavor.

In California, the lines to buy chocolate can snake out the door.  I've had See's Candies many times, most recently this assortment, and while See's makes an excellent product, the chocolate coating could be richer in flavor.  Still, these confections are above average; they easily outclass ordinary brands such as Russell Stover and Whitman's with fresher and more flavorful fillings.

I threw four bags into a quart of water and indeed, in five or six minutes, I had a pale, peachy brew. It tasted a bit weak--perhaps I needed more time or more bags, so I'm going to try steeping (with room temperature water) for ten minutes and see how it goes. Meanwhile, the tea, although weaker than I'd prefer, is very good and the peach flavor is very natural and I like it a lot. I did not need to add sweetener, but a few drops of stevia or some fruit syrup could work fine. I think it's good just as it is. It's very thirst-quenching and zero calorie, and I'm enjoying it on a hot summer day.

After a few days most of the leaves were gone and at the 2 week point there was only 1 green leave attached.  I gave it to a friend who also enjoys bonsai trees because I hated that it was starting to die.  I can report after a couple of months of total TLC it has started to regrow some of the leaves.

Celestial Seasoningss is a great company, kudos to them as mentioned earlier for responsibly packaging their product with recycled paper, and using less resources by no individual wrappers.

I keep using the teabag this way unti it's not so dark, and time to get another! It's a good thing the teabags make lots of tea per bag, you probably won't stop at one cup!

rabbit | clover | flesh | coyote | miss | head | cheese | ease | rarebit | tee | item | packaging | hat | riddle | mystery | enigma | end | knife | kitchen,"There once was a rabbit named Clover
Sold by Amazon, over and over
When they said he was fresh
They did NOT mean his flesh
Which would make a coyote* keel over

When I saw he was missing his head
I surmised that old Clover was dead
So I took out some cheese
Which I melted with ease
And served some Welsh rarebit instead

*pronounced kahy-OH-tee

Note: This item does not come with Amazon's easy-open packaging.
It took me quite a while to find it hidden inside the shiny black top hat, even though the instructions stated quite clearly that it was a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.  In the end, I used the knife, in the kitchen.

tree | week | jump | start | wood | piece | complaint | spot | trunk | branch | grafting | train | ramification | pot | enthusiast | quality | display | show | work | art | item | home | decor | spring | redwood | ground,"Very lovely/healthy tree. I know it looks dead in the pics but it is just dormant, the buds are swelled and ready to bloom any week now! My favorite part is the spectacular NEBARI! This tree will give me a jump start on a red wood bonsai piece. The only complaint i have is there is a bare spot on the lower part of the trunk... it will require some branch grafting before i can begin training it for bonsai. I think i should also mention that other than the bare spot on the trunk, the top of the tree has an excellent start on ramification. The tree comes in a very sturdy ceramic pot. If you are a bonsai enthusiast like myself, the pot that comes with the tree is only training quality, it is not a presentable display pot for showing off your work of art. However if you are not a bonsai enthusiast and want this item for home decor it is still a beautiful pot. Can't wait until the spring so i can plant my redwood in the ground to thicken up the trunk!","I have a hugely beautiful pine tree that just needs to be cut out for one week. It's been a huge success for me. I didn't even have a single branch at all, so I bought this one"

sauce | faint | tongue | add | blend | flavor | hotness | combination | deal | grocery | store | vinegar | peppery,"This is absolutely my favorite hot sauce. But it's really hot. Not for the faint of tongue. It goes great with burritos, steaks, and hotdogs, adding just the right blend of hot and peppery flavor.
Taste and hotness combine into a very potent and delicious combination.
You might be able to get a better deal at a local Mexican or Hispanic grocery store. That's actually where I get mine.
Compared with Tabasco, I think Tabasco has more of a vinegar flavor. El Yucateco's hot green sauce has more of a pungent peppery flavor.","I like thissauce because it's so light and just...perfect.

We don't like the pancake syrup as much.  I don't know if it is really different to have partially invented sugar syrup versus cane sugar syrup as ingredient. But it tastes different to us.  I looked back in my past orders.  British delights is the new supplier that sent me the pancake syrup (not as good as the original one).,I used this twice a time and it was like a pancake syrup cane sugar cane. I guess the other supplier is the same person that I used as the pancake ingredient. I made it up to 4 cups of

I went through the first small bottle in no time but I believe this 33 oz. bottle will last a long time. This can be used whenever you need vanilla. It is not really a paste but it is thicker than regular vanilla. Now that I have all that unused regular vanilla I  may dab it behind my ears.",I was called upon to make this a vanilla paste.

People are vastly over-concerned about MSG: it's a very small percentage of people who may have a legitimate reaction to the stuff, apparently.  Consider that the Japanese put it in tons of their food, and it's all over our food too (anything made with bouillon, for example).

This is the best mayo.  It makes everything it touches delicious.  Sometimes I have to force myself not to buy it because we end up putting it on everything, and I worry at the thought of consuming that much mayo (ie, for fat and cholesterol reasons, but msg concerns).

Try this, you'll be hooked.",I was really sad when Tigi stopped eating all the food on this island and I started using some sort of bouillon as an example. It helps me keep my food intake low and bouillon free. I also like that it doesn

We used to flour and oil our cake pans. But they would break or the side would stick. When I discovered this spray I hoped it would work. It does!!! It is the only spray I will use for my cakes. I just spray the pan and add the cake batter! It makes life so much easier. Don't spray the pan and then let it sit. Spray the pan and then add the batter as soon as possible.

If you think Tabasco is hot, read no further as this sauce is not for you.

I vaguely recall the first time I tasted this sauce, putting the end of a toothpick in the thick dark concoction and dabbing it onto my tongue and experiencing a very unpleasant feeling.  That was then.  Now I can easily put a generous drop on each bite of my sandwich or pizza, even with my morning eggs sometimes.  Yes, I am addicted to hot sauce and I will say that I have tried hundreds of different kinds.  This one, in my opinion, is the most flavorful while still delivering a good slap of heat.

I know there are some die-hard Blair fans out there.  I will try and compare the two in as simple a way as I can.  While I prefer Dave's for the reasons mentioned above, I do acknowledge that Blair has managed to get much ""hotter"" mixtures and have a more of a ""gen-x"" or ""bad ass"" marketing campaign.  They will offer you insanely hot sauces, that aren't really sauces because they're simply pure extract.  Anyone can make extract that'll make your rectum erupt, but to make a sauce that is actually flavorful is the kicker.  The closest sauce to Dave's Insanity would probably be After Death.  The spice level is pretty similar, but Blair's has a grainy, almost sandy texture to it that kind of eats away at your palette.  My experience with Dave's has been the opposite, as it is smooth and has a nice texture to it.

It all really comes down to preference, but as long as you have a good heat tolerance, this one delivers that and great flavor too.",I am writing this because I have never had a toothpick fall out of the tongue. I was delighted and surprised that I was able to do this without losing its edge. I tried other mouthwashes and my teeth looked alike

The texture was somewhat like saw-cutting grains stuck together but the flavor was quite good, one of the better-tasting nutrition bars. Not bad at all. I guess the granular thingy indicates a lot of fiber, and I can stand that. My nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market had them on sale for a buck each. Good deal.

But I was coloring white chocolate so it makes sense. I have never gotten true colors from dye, if I need red, black or brown I just buy candy melts.

cake | bit | twinkle | color | impact | effect | conjunction | lavender | icing | spread | place | look | stone | light | life | supply | product | purpose | sand | quality,"Cake sparkles are intended to give just that; a bit of twinkling color.  If used alone, the impact is subtle.  If you want to enhance the effect, use them in conjunction with a purple or lavender color underneath.  I use them with royal icing (it hardens) on cookies.  After spreading the icing, immediately sprinkle the sparkles on top.  The icing will hold them in place.  The two layers create a beautiful, richer look.  Think of a precious stone.  Without being cut properly, the stone won't sparkle.  But, with facets and light, it comes to life.  That's what the cake sparkles do for your flat icing.  I keep a supply of several colors and have never been disappointed with my finished products.

This is not a product that you can taste.  It's not sweet.  Its purpose is to complement your baked goods, unlike sanding sugars or sprinkles/jimmies.

Even in tiny quantities, it's easy to pick up on the sharpness, and surprisingly, a sort of aromatic sweetness. I don't know if this is typical of ghost chilis, but the sauce is more than just hot.

It does have an acquired taste, I was brought up with candy like this.  They have a different, tangy, spicy taste to it and the texture is almost like an airhead, but a little more granulated and not smooth.  I honestly love the taste of this, reminds me of when I was a little one.  The Mexican stores around where I live stopped selling these and made me very sad.  I'm just glad I can actually find my Mexican candy on Amazon!! I cannot rate the vendor because I have not purchased it from anyone through Amazon, however, I can rate the item and I give that 5 stars.  It's a little piece of childhood!

I realized that the only reason I have been buying that brand is because it's the only one at my grocery store, when I saw Cafe du Monde on amazon I decided to give it a try.  I wish I would have tried it sooner.

It has a much smoother finish than my other brand. A less bitter taste as well, very enjoyable.  I always mix my chicory with a bit of sugar and milk or cream, but I imagine this would do just fine on its own.

strawberry | flavor | gum | caution | gas | day | bubble | time,"This strawberry flavor tastes very phony and kinda weird. My favorite flavor of Orbit gum is the Tropical Remix. None of these gums' flavors lasts more than about 6-7 minutes at most. Caution: the more pieces you chew the more gas you will pass (I mean severe). And if you chew 2 entire packages within a day, you'll probably get diahrrea like I did!!!

We always soak and sprout them, but they do taste pretty good and smooth with a nice flavor just regular as a snack too. I read all of the info and reviews about raw/sprouting etc and it seems these are popular and legit as far as all that goes, though we are beginners to this area FTL seems to be reputable and well recommended.

There were a decent amount of broken/cracked almonds, I suppose this can't be avoided but it did seem a little more than expected - I'd say maybe 15-20% overall. Again totally ok to snack on and taste yummy even without soaking so we just eat the cracked and broken ones this way, but it was a little disappointing - could be how these large bags all come though regardless of brand

Price is definitely not cheap but compared to other raw bags of this size it was a on the lower side, and if you are in the market for these you know you know they just cost more. Worth it though for us at least to have lactose free, healthy fresh almond milk :)

food | sauce | label | print | need | mary | important | difference | variety | version | way | background | taste | water | chili | vinegar | salt | company | blend | sweetness | acid | component | line | consideration | star | rating | depend | palette | warning | mind | low | shipping | bottle | basis | update | photo | product | picture | description,"Lets face it - the Mexicans love hot food and generally know how to make a fine hot sauce. While the label (in small print) says ""extra hot"" there are many other sauces which are far, far hotter.  Think in terms of needing 5 or 6 drops for a bloody mary rather than spoonfuls when using this sauce. It is far from being ""extra hot"". I'd call it medium hot.

Important: There is a significant difference between this ""extra hot"" variety of Valentina and their regular version. The easiest way to tell the two apart is the regular version has a light yellow background on the label and this one - the so called ""extra hot"" has a black background on the label. To my taste, the ""extra hot"" is far superior.

Ingredients (as copied from the label): water, chili peppers, vinegar, salt ...

Which chili peppers Valentina used is unknown, yet the company has certainly created a nice blend. You can easily detect some sweetness in this sauce and that has to be due to a nice blend of the chiles. There are no added sugars!

Normally I don't like much (if any) vinegar in a hot sauce, yet I don't mind it all in this particular variety of Valentina. The difference may be this sauce uses actual vinegar while most others use acetic acid (a chemical component of vinegar) and the taste of the chili peppers dominate in this particular blend of Valentina. I want to emphasize that this is ONLY true for this particular variety.

The bottom line is this is a nicely blended hot sauce worthy of your consideration. My four star rating means this is a very good hot sauce, yet, depending on your palette, you might find a few that are better.

Warning: there is a significant difference between the regular Valentina and the so-called ""extra hot"" (black label) variety. In the regular version a heavy taste of vinegar is quite evident while in the ""extra hot"" variety it is much better balanced, ie, the vinegar is in the background. So it is quite important that you choose the so-called extra hot version - the one with a black background on the label. Keep in mind, the ""extra hot"" is not much hotter than the ""regular"" version

This is a near perfect hot sauce for a bloody mary and many other foods.

BTW: Watch out for sellers that price the sauce low but charge very high shipping charges on a per bottle basis

Update: July, 2013. The Amazon photo for this product shows the regular version of this sauce (note the yellow background on the label) and not the ""extra hot"" version which has a black background on the label. I assume someone just inserted the wrong picture. The description says it is the ""extra hot"" version.",I'm a diehard bare minerals fan. This is the only sauce that I've found that doesn't have much to do with salt. I don't think that the difference between the two is the one with the

The bag is a great size and last for a while. It has a nice zipper seal which helps keep the flaxseed fresh, and can just be popped right into the fridge. I use it for the great health benefits and increasing my fiber. I add it to my smoothies, breakfast, and sometimes salads. I like how fine the flaxseed is ground, I don't even notice it added too my food!","I have ground flaxseed in my bag and it's all good.

corn | alternative | course | product | richness | depth,I can't have any corn products so this is a great alternative.  Now of course I would use this product anyway as it adds a richness and depth you don't get otherwise.,I have been using this corn for years and found an alternative to the usual oily breadcrumbs that are sometimes used as preservatives. I find this product to be extremely rich and offer a depth of depth to my product.
product | flavor | flaxseed | quality | bread | week | family | addition | way | fiber | diet | take | time | egg,"Product has a light nutty flavor; it's really yummy.  This flaxseed is fresh and high quality.  I used it to bake brownies and bread this week and they turned out really well-my family couldn't tell there was any flaxseed in them but I noticed the light flavor addition.  This is a great way to add omega-3 and fiber to your diet without taking yucky supplements.  From what I understand, flaxseed can be used to replace eggs in recipes.  This is my first time using, so I only replaced 1 egg in my recipes with 2 tablespoons of flaxseed and it turned out great!","I recently had this product because it's my favorite, ever. I have never had flaxseed in my family. In fact, it's so delicious and I highly recommend it. It is high quality, and has been USDA"
tea | blend | complement | mate | flavor,"This is such a tasty tea blend!  The flavors combine so nicely; black is actually a very nice complement for the strong mate, as it enhances, but doesn't overpower the flavor.  Very tasty!",I recently had this amazing blend of tea and almond flavor with my new mate's flavor. I like that it has no artificial flavor and neither does it have any artificial color. I do like that this blend complements or

I have referred all of my almond loving friends to order from this company.  However, I was extremely disappointed with my last order.  I ordered 2 very large bags, but so many of the nuts were sour! Every 1 out of every 6 was so gross I had to spit them out.  No one would eat them.  I spoke to one of my coworkers, who I had referred to buy these nuts, and she said her last batch was sour as well.  Nuts are so expensive and I order such large quantities I don't want to risk receiving another bad batch and will be looking for a different seller. So disappointed  ):",I wanted something that was natural and this multiple taste. I was delighted with the quality of the service I received. I fell in love with the company and fell in love with the company. The first batch of my orders arrived in good time
concoction | thing | flavor | heat | last | habanero | sting | death | sauce | experience | beer,I love super hot hot sauces and this flagitious concoction is the hottest thing I have ever tasted. The flavor is really good and the heat is long lasting habanero sting. Blair's ultra death hot sauce is legit and shouldn't be over looked but in my experience not as hot or as long lasting. I don't understand one sauce or beer types of people buy lots of hot sauces!,I like that this concoction is not the same thing as the other ones I've tried. It's just too much heat. When I combine this with other flavors (including the habanero) it creates a

I use it in my home made coffee creamer as well as sprinkling on cookies and other baked items. It does not contain sugar, which is a plus for me.  It just gives a mild vanilla flavor to whatever we use it on. I would buy again, but only because I haven't found something better....yet.",I love thisvanilla powder flavor.

flavor | lot | brand | say | salt | traditionalist | vinegar | sauce | acid | water | having | taste | habanero | green | bit | red | tomato | paste | salsa | set | chipotle | accord | bbq | zing | drawback | stuff | oz | price | problem | food | coloring | health | shade | fluorescent | put | toothpaste | look | color | give | heat | ask | glass | bottle | shipping | packing | package | hour | time | pick | purchase,"I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor of these sauces. Seems like a lot of people bash this brand saying the sauces aren't hot, too much salt, blah blah... I must be a traditionalist, lots of salt and vinegar in a hot sauce seems normal to me. And these sauces DO contain vinegar (acetic acid + water = vinegar).
  Having said that, the primary flavor of all of these sauces is chiles. The red, green, and extra hot all taste of habanero. I like the green the best, it's a tiny bit hotter than the red and has a more tangy flavor (more vinegar?). The red just tastes like a basic habanero sauce. It's significantly hotter than Tabasco but not crazy. I wouldn't want anything milder, but the red and green are both hot enough.
  The Extra Hot is hotter than the others, maybe 50% hotter. If you've tried Melinda's Naga Jolokia Sauce or Tropical Pepper Company's Ghost Pepper sauce, those are both FAR hotter than the Extra Hot. The flavor on this one is a bit different than the red and green; probably because it contains tomato paste. It almost tastes like an extremely hot salsa, only without the chunks, and thicker.
  The best sauce in this set, by far, is the Chipotle. It's not very hot at all, possibly even less than Tabasco, but the flavor is great. It has a very strong smoky chipotle flavor, and is quite sweet (it's the only sauce out of the four that has any calories, according to the labels). Really this is more of a bbq sauce with a bit of zing. The only drawback is that bbq sauce is very inexpensive, and this stuff is over $4 for 5oz. The flavor is so good it's almost worth that price.
  The biggest problem I have with these sauces, specifically the red and the green, is that they contain food coloring. I don't care about any health effects, but honestly the green is a very strange shade of green. Almost fluorescent. I feel like I'm putting toothpaste on my food almost, and it makes me want to eat without looking at my food. The red is not nearly as strange a color.
  I would definitely recommend this set to anyone not addicted to extract sauces. I'm giving four stars instead of five because none of these sauces totally blew me away with flavor or heat (although both were good), and because of the food coloring. Other than that, everything was solid. I see some people asking about the bottles. They are 4oz glass bottles, slightly smaller than the standard 4.7oz, except for the Chipotle which is a 5oz bottle.
  Shipping was fast, and the packing was excellent. Thankfully this package was NOT shipped via UPS. I hate them, they never leave packages and make me waste an hour of my time picking up a $20 purchase.",I have a lot of culinary talent but I find it to be very close or even near to home and I am very happy with what I do.

I have used this mix to make jerky with 93% ground beef. Higher quality beef better the result. The original and teriyaki are very good, just the right amount of heat and sweetness. The Hot and Spicy mix packs a nice hot punch with a mild sweetness. I prepare jerky in a dehydrator and finish with cold smoking for 2 hours. Smoking is what take good jerky and makes it extraordinary. I prefer this to the original mix from A.C. Legg.","I like this jerky pack dehydrator and it's no longer available.

I had used flaxseed for years and it has made my health more manageable.
husband | salt | flavoring | beef,"My husband and I cannot eat much salt and this suites us fine.  It tastes so good.  You would not know how low the salt is so you can use it for flavoring.  I like that you have it for beef, pork,,poultry, etc.  Very good.",Husband salt is a nice flavoring of beef mince. I like that it's not as sweet or spicy as some of the heavily flavored beef stews that I've tried.

The tea I had at the restaurant was a golden color with a slightly sweet taste and aroma of Jasmine. I have bought so many teas trying to find it. The saleslady at the fancy tea shop assured me that this was the tea I have been looking for. NOT!

go | counterpoint | sauce | chili | chance | soup | consistency | tomato | paste | heat | pepper,"O.k., I'm going to offer a counterpoint to all the positive reviews.  I did not like this hot sauce, and I like hot sauce!  This may be good in chili (and I will try it there as soon as I get a chance), but it is not a general hot sauce for your eggs, soup, sandwiches, whatever.

It is very thick and has the consistency of tomato paste.  The heat is derived from peppers and ""pepper extracts"" (read: capsaicin).

If you want flavorful heat you can use everywhere, try somewhere else.  I recommend Melinda's Naga Jolokia for one.","I am going to try this for the counterpoint.

Well he must have thought this was Tiger sauce or something for nothing could prepare him for what came next. He took a bite of his steak and instantly felt like his mouth was on fire. This experience lasted hours and hours. This person claims they will be more careful next time. A few drops is probably all you need.

package | squeeze | bottle | hand | taste | content | flavor | chemical | smell | aftertaste | experience,"Meh. Love the package, a soft squeeze bottle which makes it very easy to manage with one hand. But the taste, not so much. I was hopeful that the MSG content would mean the flavor was lively and fresh. But its heavy, dull, very chemical in smell and taste. Even the aftertaste is a disappointing experience. Homemade is best, Hellman's is second best. This is just weird.","I was really disappointed that Avon discontinued this pack because it's so small and is almost 3x the size of the original bottle.

sugar | flavor | bit | lot | evening | cream,Pretty good and sugar free. That's important enough to buy again. I like another brands flavor a bit more but it has a lot of sugar. Really good in the evening with a top off of Bailey's or St. Brendans cream.,I really like thissugar flavor. It is a bit bitter and sometimes I have to take another bite for it to be true.

husband | sauce | connoisseur | ghost | pepper | come | man | jalapenos | snack | flavor | favorite,"My husband is a hot sauce connoisseur, and I bought 3 ghost pepper sauces for him to try and compare, one of which was this one.  He opened it first and admitted that it was VERY hot.  (This coming from a man who eats whole fresh jalapenos raw as a snack.)  But I could tell he wasn't wild about the flavor.  So he opened another of the 3 bottles and was WOWED by the flavor.  Dave's is hotter, but the flavor just isn't there.  So if you just want HOT, go for this one.  If you want both, look further.  I would recommend his favorite, Melinda's.","I recently had this amazing sauce from Sri Lanka and this connoisseur will be able to tell you how much I love this sauce.

Both my wife and I have them on our key chains.  And a few are hanging as trophies in our kitchen.

Because we love ""Blair's Jalapeno Death Sauce with Tequila.""  It's really yummy, and has tons of flavor.  Look at that ingredient list: Fresh jalapeno, shallots, tomatillos, garlic, lime juice, agave tequila.  Yum, yum, yum.  I could go for some right now!

And because this is only a jalapeno sauce, it really isn't all that spicy.  This is not one of those ""Death"" sauces that you parcel out a toothpick at a time and where a single bottle can last years. (Although I own quite a few of those as well!)  You can feel free to pour this sauce on in generous portions.

I love this sauce on eggs.  On tacos.  On pretty much everything.  But probably my favorite use is to make some toast with butter, then slather this jalapeno sauce all over it for breakfast.  It's awesome!","I've used a dozen of these things since they were first introduced to them in Madera in the early 90's and for some years had them hang in the house and my wife would hang them in the bathroom, where they"

Second, this is incredibly good stuff!  I had been looking for golden syrup specifically to make a recipe called British Flapjacks, but it was not to be found anywhere near where I live, not even at Whole Foods.  I made the recipe using brown rice syrup and was pretty pleased, but I really wanted to make it ""authentic"" as the golden syrup is supposed to make all the difference.  So I decided to check at Amazon, and here it is.  I should have known.  I must say that the packing was not the best, 6 bottles just rolling around inside a box, but all were intact and no leaking, so I lucked out there.  So I'm off to make my British Flapjacks with my golden syrup. Yum yum.","I was looking for a service that will make your rice look palatable and not greasy.

AFTER CONTACTING SUPPLIER:
I did contact the supplier and they apologized and sent me a free 1lb canister of these same cookies and they were wonderful tasting.  So, if you love home made oatmeal raisin cookies these are very very good.

category | sort | tomato | base | flavor | heat | spice | sandwich | sauce | taste,"I put this in the category of 'super spicy sauces' - but - I don't think it is by any means too spicy.

Flavor isn't too bad, a sort of smoky tomato base flavor.  More than anything, the heat comes through.

This is pretty good for spicing up soups, chilies, etc.  However, not really all that good for spicing up a sandwich or something, not because it is too hot, just don't care for the flavor that much 'straight up.'

All said, this is better than your average 'super spicy' sauce.  Most seem to just have the awful capsaicin extract flavor (and nothing else), which to me is inedible due to the terrible taste, not even the heat.  Dave's really isn't bad, but not my favorite either.","I would recommend thiscategory as a whole. It is basically a kind of tomato base with a slightly wavy, medium flavor.

chemical | food | teaspoon | pot | end | pinky | mouth | place | need | product | bottle | couple,I love spicy foods but this counts more as a potentially dangerous chemical than a food.  I put about 1/8 teaspoon in a pot of beans and the whole pot is noticeably spiced up.  I tiny dab on the end of your pinky will send your mouth into fiery place.  There is no need for their even hotter product.  I figure one bottle will last me a couple of years.,I'm a big fan of the pheromones that are found in everyday foods and this little pot is perfect.

The Tabasco flavor is not to much and I am very happy with the purchase. If you like tangy, spicy (and I do), one of the best tasting mayonnaise that I've ever had. Not best price, if you are merely comparing cost and ounce to dollars and cents, and comparing this high-quality specialized one to a cheap store-brand generic one, but if quality and flavor matter to you, this is a very good product. Makes sandwiches or snacks taste extra good. Adds a little zing to life -- I've used it on snacks, with pretzels -- just about anything you can think of,,,,and it only makes things taste better.

So I took a large drink of it plain like I do all my sauces to try. (I do use a spoon) WOW! It hit my hard and fast. My tummy was hurting as sweat pored from my pores. In short, it was awesome! This is a real hot sauce and is the first one I have tried that I would grab over Habanero Tabasco. I am use to really hot things so those who are not should use caution and not try to drink it by itself. The flavor is also wonderful and I enjoyed it on my simple salad of some lattice and dressing with this. It does need to be kept refrigerated which means I cant keep a bottle in my purse for when eating out like I do with Tabasco so that's a shame. Otherwise, this is a new favorite. 9 out of 10.",I was just thinking maybe this sauce would be great. I had a bad tummy but after drinking it I realized I had a problem.

The Kutbil-Ik or Habanero Extra Hot sauce is, well, extra hot and lacks the balance of the standard Habanero Red. If you want hotter sauces, seek out the products of the specialty producers, but if you want a standard well balanced hot sauce without vinegar as a base nobody beats El Yacateco.","I was excited to try this bodega flavor.

Instead of coming in one pound wedges, it came in several smaller plastic wrapped cuts. As it turns out, this was a good thing. This cheese is well aged and delicious, a perfect snacking cheese.

I plan on using it shredded within the rice mixture and on top of stuffed green peppers.

fan | lack | quality | reindeer | cake,"I'm a fan of Wilton products.  Rarely do I ever get something that is lacking in quality.  I picked up the ""Cinnamon Drops"" to use as noses for my reindeer cake pops.  They worked great, looked great and taste great!  Definitely would purchase these again.",I am a diehard redeer fan. I find their lack of quality reindeer cake helpful.
