This version is buggy, slow, and crashes likes someone's paying it to do so I can't tell you how many times Word has crashed in the middle of updating an important file and the supposed ""AutoRecovery"" file is from hours earlier. Yes, it's my own fault for not saving more often, but when you're in the groove, you're in the groove. That doesn't excuse this program's fault, and they've got some nerve charging this much for an update that's not worth the disk it's burned on. I won't even talk about how slow PowerPoint is. It takes a few minutes to open on my brand-new iMac as well as on my 2007 MacBook, so I know it's not processor speed that's causing the problem. In fact, the only program I can recommend on this disk is Excel, and that's bc it's pretty hard to screw that one up.

In this day and age, it's pretty much impossible to be a Mac user working across platforms without having Office, so if you must, take my advice and just stick to 2004. Hopefully they'll get rid of the bugs in the next update, but I'm not holding my breath.","I have been using this version because I didn't realize that I need to update my software every other 12 months.

So, if you were satisfied with the performance of the 2013 version of this security suite, nothing about this version should cause any concern (...well, other than installing it which we'll get to in a moment). If the interest is a first time install or a revisit to the Norton family, I am going to reiterate much of last year's review, because for the typical home user, I still believe this security alternative is among the most comprehensive and easiest to use packages presently available whether the need is for one PC or multiples.

However, as far as installation is concerned, there is unquestionably room for improvement. With the de-emphasis of internal optical drives, many software developers are moving toward downloadable products. Norton 360 still has a physical CD available but the recommended option is download from the Norton site, so naturally my choice is to install from the CD which is supposed to upgrade the existing version...yeah, right or more accurately.. yeah, but not without encumbrances like a conflict between two versions that is not resolvable without a hard restart. My suggestion would be to delete the old version and do a fresh install if the decision is to go with CD install. It might mean loss of histories, existing network mapping and resetting preferences but it might also be less of a headache than trying to transfer them via the supposed upgrade capability. From my second PC, I did go the online route and it worked without incident.

That said, and feeding into my unabashedly admitted laziness, the following is an excerpt from last year's review, and as I am a fan of the 360 product, probably a preview of my review of next year's version:

Norton 360 is a comprehensive security suite with an array of processes and tasks consolidated in a single application. The complement of features can be found in the manufacturer's description above. Each of the features could be addressed through other resources and admittedly, a few of them might well be more effectively administered by standalone apps, but for the user who wants to set it and forget it, this product is among the top choices.

For less knowledgeable users, who may desire to find out more about security protocols and firewall settings, there are support functions here that can assist and increase awareness of threats they may not have even known they could monitor, of particular interest if surfing curiosity takes the user to a wide range of unknown sites.  I know with dynamic IP assignment, 360 is a fast and convenient way to identify physical addresses for all of the devices I have on my network with logging on the router.  Backup to external drives or online to the Norton storage site is also supported. In fact, the only difference between the standard and Premium additions of this suite is the amount of basic online storage available, with the standard addition providing 2GB and the Premium 25GB. Users, however, with multi-device platforms including Macs and mobile devices would be better served by purchasing the Multi-device version of this software.

I am rather obsessive about running registry cleanup and 360 offers another utility to supplement the shareware app I use most regularly. I do so because I do think any one product successfully identifies all files that could be cleaned. Similarly, Startup manager is another utility that can be assessed elsewhere but is another convenience found in this product and scanning performance can be improved by adjustments available with Norton Insight.","I was looking for a product that will help minimize the potential for downtime and the user interface.

I have a little over 2 months left on my current N360 subscription and saw the 2013 version available a  nice price here on Amazon, so I bought another 3PC one user box. I have to wait untill my current subscription expires or a day or so untill it does to enter the new KEY, because if I did it now, I would lose the remainder of my current subscription.

OK, I've said enough that is not really review material, but should be useful to anybody using Norton.
Review-wise, I think Norton 360 is a great product and works well for me. The only issue I have with it is the stupid cloud based  (these days) password ""vault"". I preferred the older, local  password manager, which on one of my PC's, is the way I still have it set up. I made the mistake of logging onto Symantec one day with my user ID and password, and it kind of ""Grabbed"" my password manager and made it the cloud based vault thing, which sounded OK, but when I logged into it with my Laptop, which had fewer log-ins and passwords, it for some crazy reason synched the cloud data FROM my laptop. When I used my desktop next time, the Cloud password data got synched TO my desktop and I lost 3/4 of my log ins and passwords. Fortunately, I back up my passwords to a local hardrive file with a built in, but awkward to find utility in Norton to import or export, and I was able to get it all back.
Other than that quirk. I like the software a while lot. It runs smotthly, and does not cause my PC's to crash.

Anyway, nobody showed me how to do anything related to video editing and I was really starting from square one on my own.  It took a bit of time, but simply by playing around with it a bit, I figured out how to do most things I could think to want to do.  The interface made sense and their documentation was sufficient for me to learn by playing.

Back then, Pinnacle was pretty buggy.  Several times I would want to throw something at my computer because the program would crash and lose the last hour of my work.  That was a big deal, however, everything else about Pinnacle made me very happy.  Since then, I've tried my hand at several other video editing suites including (and I don't even know if some of these are around anymore) Roxio Video Wave, Cyberlink Power Director, Corel Video studio, Ulead Video Studio, and even Adobe Premier Pro.  There are pluses and minuses on most of them (I say ""most"" because some are all ""minus"" and no ""plus"").  For example, while Adobe Premier Pro is super powerful, I can never figure out how to do what I want to do on it (not to mention it is super expensive if you don't know somebody who works for Adobe and can get it for you for like 10% of the original cost).

So, what is a budding video editor to do?  What suite should they buy?

I still love Pinnacle Studio and from my experience (not that I do this every day or anything), they have really polished their software and it is not buggy like the old versions used to be.  If you choose this suite, you'll be able to do most anything you want.  As a side note, I also really enjoy using PowerDirector for the same reasons--powerful and easy to use.  However, this version of Pinnacle Studio comes with a bonus that I got excited about: live screen captures!  There have been many times I've wanted to be able to record what I was doing on screen, but when last I seriously looked into it (a while ago, I admit) all the software to do it was expensive and I didn't want to spend money on it.  Now I get it as a free bonus to an already great program.

Also
I was sad to learn a few years ago that Corel bought Pinnacle.  I'm not a fan of Corel, primarily because I don't like their tendency to use the Protexis licensing service due to the fact that I have noticed system stability issues from it (Corel Video Studio lived on my computer for about 1 day before I uninstalled it and threw it out).  This is why I was thrilled to learn that even though Pinnacle is owned by Corel, it did not install Protexis.  YAY!

As I continue to use Pinnacle Studio 18, I'll update if I find any issues, but so far I'm very happy with it.

Since I bought this product Intuit has discontinued development of Quicken. They are supposed to sell it to some other vendor. I've never seen a software sale of this magnitude work. For that reason alone this would be a two star rather than three star purchase.

What takes it down to 1 star is that today I'm getting Quicken emails about spending patterns. I did not (knowingly) enable online access to my accounts.

Don't use this product.

--------
The market for personal finance software is not what it was 15 years ago. It is now a niche market. (The reason why that happened is beyond the scope of an Amazon review.)

I am sure nobody would develop Quicken for Windows (the gold standard) today. It's development was funded in a different era, including the painful process of establishing connections to banks. So we can't compare a new product (Quicken for Mac 2015) to that product. If you want all those features you need to run windows in a Mac VM or do dual boot.

So we compare this product to using a spreadsheet (ugh) or iBank 5. Unfortunately that's a very hard comparison to make. I mentioned this was a niche market -- I've not seen any serious head-to-head comparisons from a trusted source.

I opted for this product assuming it leveraged the bank connectivity network funded by Quicken for Windows. It does indeed do that.

It is not a stellar product. It desperately, desperately, needs a manual -- but the finance market is now so small that even niche ePublishers won't write a guide for it. Installation and configuration was quirky. Manual setup of 529 and other non-integrated investment tools is weird. I ran into several UI bugs and usability issues.

There's no Help file.

On the other hand, after initial setup it's bringing data in from a variety of investment sources and multiple US bank accounts. That's something.

I think it's worth the money. A manual might even make it four stars.","I was excited to see the latest version of the Apia etihad software. It is now available to download for free or at a discounted price, usually for two or three months. The main reason for this is because"

Most retail offerings are overpriced, difficult to install, and confusing to maintain.  And then the cherry on top is that they typically bog down your computer's performance while letting the bad stuff through anyway.

But PC Tools Internet Security 2009 has turned me around on this topic.  It installed easily on my Windows XP (sp3) workstation after I had removed my prior security suite (begone forever, Norton 360!), including automatically retrieving all of the latest updates.  Registration was as simple as providing the product key and my email address - immensely less obtrusive than the Norton runaround.

The dashboard is easy to read, visually separating its protection against spyware, viruses, spam and intrusion (i.e. firewall) into different portions of the screen.  Globally useful information such as the most recent scan date and how many days are left on your subscription are placed in immediate view - no digging required.  Click any of the protection panes and you get detailed information including helpful links for setting runtime options and viewing historical results.  It's all very user-friendly and intuitive.

PC Tools really shines during routine use.  Aside from the times when it was running an update, the software's footprint was very manageable, both in terms of CPU and memory usage.  So no more slowdowns during browsing.  And it manages to provide this protection without cluttering up your browser with any branded toolbar nonsense - imagine that, Norton!

Its schedule, thresholds and notifications are all simple to customize so that you get the level of protection that you want without going overboard with non-stop messages and warnings.  Their IntelliGuard feature is aimed at ensuring ongoing protection while not overloading the average user with technical minutiae.  Let's face it - the average Internet user doesn't know (or even want to know) hot to properly configure his or her firewall.  IntelliGuard does a good job of doing it for the user, sparing a lot of the confusion which can actually lead to loopholes in security.

Its scans seem to be very thorough - it immediately picked up lots of resident malware and other nonsense that Norton had quietly let live on my PC for who knows how long.  This version also touts a new ""Behavior Guard"" feature that supposedly catches potential threats based on monitoring suspect activity in the OS of your computer.  Put another way, a virus doesn't have to become ""known"" and added to everyone's update list for you to be protected from it.  How well does it work?  Well, that's difficult for the layperson to assess, but I can tell you that a month in, I'm yet to have any virus or malware-related problems and I feel much more confident than I ever did with any other retail suite.  I'll certainly update this review if anything bad happens under PC Tools' watch, however.

The PC Tools Internet Security suite comes bundled with licenses for one year of protection for three computers, so it's also a good value compared to the retail competition.  This software has actually done what none of the other competitors I've tried could do in the past:  changed my mind for the better about anti-virus software.","I think that Minder's Antivirus product is good enough for a single user.

Nothing will replace all lawyers and accountants, but if you have some straight forward will, power of attorney, final arrangements, or need info about caregivers and survivors, this looks to be a well written computer program.

I have it running Windows 7 (64bit) with no issues.  It's got the tax-software wizard type approach, interviewing you and asking questions, you answer them and at the end, it has created for your forms that can be printed and filed with those that need to have these.

It's enough to get a general education, informed, but probably not enough to solve all your legal questions.  Still, it's in there, take a look at it.

Bottom line: about 25 years ago we paid a lawyer to create the will that we still have in place today.  Our will is not complicated.  This program will allow me to re-create that and bring it up to date, without any lawyer fees.

I will follow up with a more complete review when I finish my own taxes.

I have used this program year after year, so I don't expect to find too many faults, but as I said, I will do an update.  What I should have done is wait for a better price.  I bought it at 34 dollars and change.  You can get it now for 19 dollars and change.  Tax law has changed allowing banks, businesses, etc. to wait until much later to provide your tax information therefore there really is no need to buy early.

Update:  This year's version provides for downloading tax info from many financial firms.  Most firms have established deadlines when this feature will be available.  My firm will be ready to download on February 2nd.  Of course, you always have the option to enter the info from a paper form, or using online data at the firms web site.
The tax software itself has had one update in late January and another update is scheduled for February 23rd.  Without the updating being completed (there may be more), you cannot submit your return with any confidence it is correct.  The software will tell you if another update is planned.

Update:  I downloaded data from my financial firm.  Numerous entries were created for Interest, Dividends, and Stock Sales.  It marks each entry asking you to verify each one.  All entries were accurate.  The download saved me a lot of time.

Update:  I submitted 6 returns (3 Federal and 3 State) for members of my family.  All electronically submitted returns were accepted by the IRS within 1 day.  All returns sailed through processing and refunds came very quickly as direct deposits.  The State returns cost $19.95 to submit electronically.  All Federal returns were free to submit electronically.  The software is worth every penny I paid!",I was excited to get this review because I didn't realize that I had a lot of questions about this program before I started updating it.

That was necessitated by Intuit's (the manufacturer) decision not to allow preparation of Schedule E (royalty & rental income) forms with the Deluxe version, like I could in the past. That coupled with the incessant push to make you file electronically through TurboTax (for an additional fee), made this version of TurboTax MUCH less pleasant or easy to use. Accessing and printing selected completed forms is much more difficult as well.

However, the primary problem I have with this version involves my preparation of tax returns for other family members. This is something I've done for years, as I have the time and have already purchased the TurboTax software.

After I completed our state and federal taxes this year, I started to prepare state and federal returns for a family member. I did not complete them in that same day and saved what I'd completed. When I got back to them the next day, I logged into my TurboTax on the desktop,and was informed that an update was available. After I downloaded the update, I tried to open the family member's tax return, but found it no longer existed. The only tax file that TurboTax had retained was mine.

The relative's returns were fairly straight forward, and I completed and printed them that day. I left the work I'd done saved on my computer, with backup copies. The next day, I logged into my TurboTax on the desktop,and again, was informed that an update was available. After I downloaded the ""update"", I again tried to open the family member's tax returns in TurboTax, but found it no longer existed.

I'm not saying that TurboTax Premier Fed, Efile and State 2013 with Refund Bonus Offer removed the family member's tax returns, but I've never encountered this problem before....",I have been using this software for a while now and I was excited to find the latest version of it.

The way it connects to and uses Ancestry.com.  Well that was easy enough.  That portion of the program is excellent.  You can connect, find what you need, have it automatically inserted into the right place and lots of other wonderful things with Ancestry.com.  This allows you to build a family tree quickly and is tremendously helpful if you are new or just recently started building your history.

On the other hand, this is one of the most awkward programs available to try to figure out how to do anything manually.  If you were trying to build your history by hand by talking to relatives and the like then doing things like adding a step-parent, half-sibling, child out of wedlock, etc, is a nightmare.  It can be done, but it is far from intuitive.  I have used FTM from very early versions and loved it through the first several iterations.  I started with Version 5 and loved it through version 11, then it started being more focused on features at the expense of the user interface and ease of use.  And with this version it further frustrates the user experience.  The Version 2008 was the last one I would deem user friendly.

The automatic portion can also be confusing as I found myself thinking I had downloaded content that it turns out I had not.  When I was not connected to the Internet the content was not there, but when I connected it showed up again.  It apparently keeps several items on the Internet by default.  However, I did find that I could get it onto my local copy, it was just not intuitive how to do it.

Don't get me wrong, this is great software and does pretty much everything you need.  There are just better choices if you are trying to build or edit by hand.  The bottom line is it is the best for automatically building your tree through Ancestry.com (absolutely the best online resource).  If you want to do anything else, or have to make a change in any kind of relationship, then it is one of the hardest to work with.  It will do it, but expect to spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to do it and going through the help manual and probably online help.

For me, I am using the subscription to gather information and then just imputing it into my older version.  Reports are faster, interface is cleaner, easier to make changes, searches for duplicates, exports, etc are all faster in the older version.  If they would just fix the user interface so that it was intuitive to use it I would move it up to a four or five star review.","I've used this program for years and it is now part of my family tree.

The control I have over the local tone mapping, fade correction, and all of the other photo adjustment settings helps get my point and shoot photos to look at least somewhat like DSLR photos.

It's a great, affordable alternative to Photoshop, although there are a few areas where it is lacking. Specifically when creating ""silhouette"" images (whiting out the background, blacking out the foreground). This is something that I still have to do in Photoshop, but the biggest +1 is being able to Paste new images without having to open a new image (c'mon, Adobe, you should be past this by now). It makes doing screenshots easy and quick.

Instead of renewing my 2011 version, I installed the 2012 version. One would think it would be the same thing, but it's not. 2012 is easier on my system. I immediately noticed how much faster Internet Explorer runs. I've been using Firefox because Internet Explorer was so sluggish. I thought it was all the browser's fault. Apparently, the 2011 version causes Internet Explorer to slow down. My IE is still not as fast as Firefox, but much better than before.

As for the virus protection, I'm quite satisfied with the performance of Total Protection, which is why I continue to use McAfee. For many years, my husband did not use McAfee, and he was constantly being infected while mine was virus-free. I finally installed Total Protection on his computer. We haven't had much problems since, except for the interval last year when he went without protection for a few days after the subscription expired and he immediately picked up a virus.

If you are wondering whether to install McAfee Total Protection or Mcafee All Access For Pc Mac and Mobile, I'd go with McAfee Total Protection if you are only protecting home computers. It's less expensive, and you'll ultimately get the same software on your computer. If you are also protecting tablets and cell phones, then All Access is better. All Access will protect tablets, cell phones, netbooks, notebooks and PCs. All Access will also enable a user to remotely wipe out date from cell phones and tablets.

This McAfee version can only be used on 3 PC's. They do keep track of how many PC's it's been downloaded onto. Look for sales. It can be bought for quite a bargain.","I am renewing my user account; I know this because I'm renewing it every 3 months.

I faithfully owned every version of Money Microsoft produced and then they did an end of life on there software so I switched to Quicken. Well then I got a mac and went to quicken for mac and it was nice. I used Quicken 2007 for mac for several years and finally Quicken came out with what they called ""Quicken Essentials"" which was just a useless program. They stripped out most the useful features, etc. So I downgraded back to Quicken 2007 as my primary finance tool and in parallel started playing with iBank. iBank is NOT as ""pretty"" as Quicken 2007 was which is sort of sad to say. But the software does everything I need it to do. Then when Apple announced OSX Lion and Quicken announced Quicken 2007 would not work well that just sealed the deal. I left quicken 2007 and have been using iBank 4. I've used iBank for probably 3 months now off and on and the last 2 weeks daily as my primary tool. It was a slow transition  as I wanted to get used to it slowly before I upgraded to Lion.

What I like is it works. It's simple and the web connect download of transactions is super fast. Quicken used to take a long time to download my transactions, iBank is a meere matter of seconds.

iBank also has the one feature most other software is missing, the cash flow forecast. A vital tool with how I do my budgets.

iBank is NOT the most polished piece of software I've ever used. But given the limited finance software on the mac it really is the best. Plus if you use the add-on iphone app and sync your data to it, you have one more way to keep track of your money. The app is a few bucks in the app store but it is worth it.

I'm happy with this, I wish they would fix some graphic issues, make the forecast chart look better, but that's really the only complaint I have and that's minor.

If you need finance software I recommend you download a trial version of this software from the developers website at iggsoftware and then if you like it enough to buy it, get it here on amazon as it is cheaper then buying it straight from the developer or the apple app store.","I was a user for many years and found helpful while using this program.

1.  They limit downloads, so if your computer crashes, or you get a new computer, you are out of luck.
2.  They are not people friendly, if you call.  Hopefully, you can get a native English speaker you understand.
3.  The method is ok for some people; it is a matter of personal preference.  One should develop one's own method which works best for them.  For example, repetition is best for some, memorization is best for others.  Rosetta Stone has you figure out words based on the pictures and context, and this can be much improved.  This much like how a child learns her/her own language, which is ok.  However, I think someone can make a similar method more suitable for adults.

My suggestions

1. Start with Pimseur.  This method teaches you good pronunciation from the beginning, and develops a basic speaking ability.  It repeats a lot, which many don't like, but I'm not one of them.  Repetition hammers it into your skull, so that you can automatically spit outa word without trying to remember the word.  A shortcoming to many is the limited vocabulary.  Well, this method is NOT supposed to include a large vocabulary; you can best get that from beginner readers and other materials such as French at the Wheel and Living Language courses.  They expand your knowlege, and supplement Pimsleur beautifully.

2. Read French materials on the internet, and even tune in on sitcoms via the internet.  See what the library has, and talk to others for their own ideas.

3. Carefully read reviews on Amazon and elsewhere.  Many reviews for various items seem fake, to me.  Or reviews are by people who are naive and easily impressed. So read reviews for substance, and if you have time, read what other items a reviewer has reviewed. Personally, I have no problem in harshly rating something.  I tend to give better than average ratings because I've already studied other reviewers carefully, and end up with products deserving good reviews. This review was based on looking at what someone else bought; I knew beforehand from reviews of others what it was.","I have been using this software since it launched, back several years ago.

I really liked Managing Your Money back in the 1990s, and when that went away I switched to Microsoft Money.

You do need a DVD drive to use it (three of our home computers don't have a DVD drive). You also need a mouse, that's all you need.

This is a fun program in which you manipulate the mouse to make art. Since I own and use Adobe Photoshop Elements 7 I note some of the controls are quite similar such as selecting the tool and opacity and working with layers.

To start, you just click on the type of medium you want to use (i.e. marker, pencil, paintbrush) then select the thickness, color, and opacity and you are off and running. The menu bar is in the corner and you can expand some of them if you find that easier.

I started fooling around with this without directions, since none came in a paper form and I'm a book person. However there are tutorial documents on the disc to help you. On a whim I used an internet search engine and found video tutorials from the manufacturer on YouTube. These helped me the most.

I am an amateur artist and enjoy this program. I let my kids test it out, they are aged 10 and 13 and both found it simple. They used the tools intuitively and found more features than I realized existed. They really liked the split screen mirror image tool and the one that repeats in the four quadrants what you do on the screen (imagine drawing with one line but seeing an image like a kaleidoscope).

Since I am new to making digital art, I realize there's a learning curve. While I can control a regular drawing pencil in my hand to sketch on paper, it's a completely different skill to use the mouse to replicate the same thing. It's an odd feeling to try to do something you know you can do with pencil and paper but struggle to make a smooth or straight line with the mouse as the tool. In the beginning it feels like a trick on the mind to use a mouse and see the medium you usually associate with a regular marker, paintbrush, or pencil making magic on the screen.

I have no compaints about this product.

As with any computer program or with any traditional art medium, what you get out of it depends both on what you want to do with it (translating your concept to reality) and also how much time you put into learning the skills, procedures and techniques necessary to get it to do what you want it to do.

It would be nice to have a cell phone & other devices antivirus to load as well for a full suit.

Tools are great, but again, easier to find & use on AVG for my Win7 machine )both 64 & 32 bit system (I use both, so a bit confusing as to weather the 32-bit documents, programs, etc. are actually being scanned.

I'll be switching back to AVG, as it is easier to use & to see what exactly has been scanned & it seems more through. If an infection is blocked, AVG makes it easier to find out what has been blocked, where it came from, so I can avoid going to infected sites (AVG tells you before you even go there from yout search engine & will give you the option to stop, or continue if you look it up & know it is actually safe.",I was a new user this time and I was finally able to get it working again.

After about two decades of using Quicken and regularly upgrading, I am kicking Intuit to the curb. I upgrade when I want. Period. The last time was June 2012 for Quicken. There has been nothing in newer versions to make it worthwhile to pay for an upgrade. Intuit / Quicken doesn't like that and tried to strong arm me into purchasing version 2015. Unless it's free, I don't want version 2015. It has nothing for me, but I received notice today that if I don't open my wallet and give them $20, they will take away features from my 2012 version. I have to upgrade or lose the ability to download transactions. In order to continue using that feature, I have to buy it again? Business must be bad to resort to bullying. I'm jumping from Intuit's sinking ship and looking at other options. If I find nothing, I'll rather use a spreadsheet than go back to Quicken. I know that if you give a bully your lunch money today, he'll try to force you again tomorrow and every following day. Nope, I'm standing up now and saying: Hey Intuit / Quicken, get the * out of here and go pick on someone your own size!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
About 15 years ago a friend recommended Quicken to help me manage my finances. I haven't been one to jump on the new releases. Quicken Deluxe 2012 is my 3rd upgrade and I am once again not disappointed.

My finances are nothing spectacular. I have a checking and savings accounts with two brick and mortar banks, plus another of each with ING Direct. There are loan accounts for my house and one car. 9 credit cards and 3 brokerage accounts complete my financial picture.

While the capability has been available in previous versions, this is the first time I've used the automatic update feature. I love not having to sign in to each institution's website to get transaction info to enter. Quicken pulls the info for me and presents it in an manner that allows me to accept or edit each individual transaction.

The calendar is one feature I've used and relied on for many years. I credit it for having helped me not miss even one payment in over a decade.

I can't help you compare Quicken to any other finance software, because Quicken is all I've ever used. That said, I can't think of one thing or function that I would like that Quicken doesn't provide.

The one thing that irks me is how dramatically the price has gone up since my last version. 2012 cost me more than double what I paid in 2006. With the exception of the price of the software, I am 100% satisfied.","I was kicking around with this upgrade because I was unaware of it until I tried it. But after I got to the brink of the curb, I continued to use it until I found a better version. Even though I am"

A really fun, exciting, game for girls -- that DOESN'T come in a pink box, for heaven's sake.  As a video game fan growing up in the 80s, I noticed that there were very few ""girl-oriented"" games out there.  There were plenty for boys; and a few for both sexes, like ""Tetris"" and ""Wheel of Fortune"", and, of course, the ever-popular ""Mario Bros."" series.  But even the Mario games favored boys.  There were always more male characters to choose from than females (there'd be, maybe one girl, the Princess, who sported a pink dress.) And the games JUST for girls would be, like, Atari's ""Strawberry Shortcake"" game, where you'd get to switch around everybody's outfits.  Now, in the year 2001, there's plenty of girl software out there, but I'm not interested in PC Diaries, where girls can record their innermost secrets and keep them locked up with a voice-activated password.  I've outgrown being interested in designing clothes for Barbie.  (They need a game where you can design a Barbie house!  Now that would be cool.)  Not that there's anything wrong with those games; it's just that they're very tame, and some girls, like myself, want adventure.  Believe it or not, the box for this Nancy Drew game sports the phrase ""For adventurous girls, ages 10 and up.""  That's me! (A bit over 10, but who's counting?)  But enough with the introductions -- let me describe the game.  It's an adventure game; ""Choose Your Own Adventure""-esque.  Nancy is staying in a mansion that's someday going to be a Bed & Breakfast.  There's a problem though -- a bunch of accidents have been happening.  Your job, as Nancy, is to find clues, solve puzzles, talk to people, and solve the mystery of who's responsible for the accidents.  But you soon discover that you have a SECOND mystery to deal with.  This game requires logic, patience, and a curious mind.  What amazed me was how long the game took to complete; there's really a lot to do.  But after about 14-16 hours of game play, I have finished the game, and I'm sad.  So -- I think I'll order the other two Nancy Drew games that are on amazon! ;)  Please, DreamCatcher games and Her Interactive -- keep these coming!  I want more Nancy Drew games.  I've always loved the books; and fans of the books might even laugh at how closely the game resembles the books in some instances.  Just like the Nancy Drew books changed the world of adventure books for girls; this game is a true icon of the progress in Girls' Games that's come along in the last decade.  Nancy is smart, intuitive, and strong -- and best of all, she doesn't wear a pink dress!","I bought this for because it's all plastic and wrapped around a huge box for sake of video games and the like. But for all you out here who are like me and love to play with children, I've got this set"

I like it a bit better than Pinnacle Studio or Elements, but it's not as fast as something like Edius or Lightworks, particularly in terms of real-time previews and being able to actively edit video without having to constantly try to re-render the timeline.

The layout and controls are cleaner and a bit more intuitive than Pinnacle, though complete beginners won't find it as easy as something like Windows Movie Maker or iMovie.  The out put and file formatting is also easier and pretty flexible with decent results.  I did find it a bit odd in that using the arrow keys skipped clips rather than scrubbing the timeline, and cutting clips wasn't as straightforward.  Add to that that menu items don't show the keyboard shortcuts, so you'll need to refer to the manual to get up to speed.

For home movies, exporting youtube videos and the like, it's fine.  Transitions and menu items, DVD/BD formatting and all that make it an easy all-in-one package.  Lightworks and Edius are much harder to learn, have less options, and are considerably more expensive if you want all the same features, however they offer better stability, performance and professional/semi-pro features.",I have used alot of video editing tools. Some of them are quite expensive and can be quite the bit expensive. I was lucky enough to find one that worked for me. I had to find something that worked and was able to

Installation on a PC running Windows XP (SP3) was uneventful. It took about 15 minutes start to finish, including the time to download an update from their website.

No problems pulling in last years Turbo Tax return. That's a big feature for me, since as a business owner, I have to deal with issues such as depreciation schedules. Plus, it's always helpful to see the totals for each line item from last year to make sure I didn't forget something.

I use the Deluxe version and it offers everything I need for dealing with investments and my business (Schedule C). Turbo Tax continues to try to up-sell me into the business version, but the Deluxe gives me everything needed at a lower cost.

The menu system is clear and easy to use, and the software also allows a form view so you can jump to a specific form or line item.

I'm sure other tax software works just as well, and offers the benefit of a lower cost. I stick with TurboTax mainly because it always has worked well for me, and I just prefer to stick with what I know will work. Plus, I'm concerned there would be problems pulling in the prior year's return when it was prepared with a different package.

I can't say it makes paying taxes fun, but it certainly takes the sting out of dealing with all the rules, regs, and paperwork.

This hub has the power to drive not only the full USB 2.0 rated current capacities, but beyond.  It means that, for example, one of its USB ports can power up a Western Digital Passport external USB hard disk drive which is very unusual for a hub.  Since the idea of buying a USB hub is to move functions away from your limited number of computer USB ports (especially a notebook computer!), the more of those functions it can move, the better.  And this device will let you plug that Passport in where it is out of your way.  The device is well laid out, too.  The power, input USB port, and three of the seven USB output ports are on the back end of the device (above where it says ""T7Hub"" in the photograph) which makes cable routing easier for ""permanent"" devices like printers, scanners, etc., since the cables for those come from behind it (and don't clutter the front).  And that leaves the other four USB output ports on the front side where they are easy to access, like for a memory stick, or for that WD passport drive to do a monthly software backup.  The following hardware comes inside the box: the hub, its power supply, and a USB 2.0 cable.",I was using this device for several years and found that the usb hub was nice. The USB hub is nice too.

version | experience | hand | demand | run | difficulty | have | change | credit | card | number | account | information | job | line | work | business | plunge,"I recently upgraded to this version of Quicken from Quicken 2010 Home & Business. I see very few changes that are not purely cosmetic. Although many users have complained about problems with Quicken 2013 Home & Business, I am not experiencing any obvious difficulties (except for one that I'll explain below). On the other hand, I am not doing anything particularly demanding. It's possible that I would be running into problems if I were using some of Quicken's advanced features.

The one difficulty I'm having stems from a change in my credit card number. I had previously linked Quicken with my credit card account. I received a new card with a new number. Quicken made me deactivate the account before it would take my new information, and when I reactivated the account and downloaded transactions, I wound up with a number of duplicate entries that I had to delete.

I've long used Quicken to track my finances. It has its quirks, flaws, and annoyances, but if there's something else out there that does the job better, I'm not aware of it.

Bottom line: If you already own a working version of Quicken Home & Business, you probably don't need to update. If you own a ""lesser"" version of Quicken and need the business features or you don't own Quicken at all, you might as well take the plunge.","I have been using Virtual Reality for the last 20+ years and have learned the hard way that things work.

Installation went smoothly, and initial tests of the product were encouraging. My hope was for a suite of products that would be a plug and play substitute for Microsoft Office, the standard for office product suites in today's market. The product performed well in that most of the controls were easy enough to find (if the user is moderately familiar with Microsoft Office 2007, something I still find myself struggling with on occasion). Document, presentation and spreadsheet creation and usage within the product were pretty much the expected routine, no fanfare just good functionality.

The problem I had with the product suite was with files created outside of the Corel product suite. A product that bills itself as a replacement/equivalent product for Microsoft Office needs to be able to open and work with files created under the competitor's suite. Unfortunately, after a couple of weeks of opening and having to tweak layouts on presentations or formatting in documents, I had to give up the ghost on the Corel suite; it was too much work trying to redo files created under Microsoft Office because they did not import to Corel Office cleanly.

Bottom line, I have uninstalled and returned to Microsoft Office; I just cannot afford to use a product that is not 100% compatible with the industry standard.

It comes with a 1 year subscription to their reading activities and can run on just about any computer or tablet (PC, Mac, tablet).  We installed it on a Windows 7 PC.

 Our son has just started this program with our help and so far is interested and engaged. Younger children (3  4) will need help, especially at first,  Older children (5  7) should be able to handle it with minimal adult supervision once they are comfortable following the rules and with enough of an attention span to keep with it.  The program is presented as self-paced and interactive with 10 levels of learning.  Also, as the advertising points out, ""Rosetta Stone Kids Reading responds to your childs strengths and weaknesses with targeted instruction when and if they struggle with new skills.""

 There are a lot of activities that are a part of this package (over 50 games and 600 activities), but some may find that the required yearly subscription is a little pricey.  It's not obvious that you are only buying a subscription.  Also, as some other reviewers have said, the responses from the system after entering a required answer can get a little monotonous.  A little more variety would have been nice.

 In summary, this is a good product that should help your child ease into reading at an early age.  It presents concepts in an engaging and fun way to learn.  While initial price and yearly subscription cost may be a concern to some, the advantage of solid reading skills for your child may be priceless in the long run.

Back when I was teaching, I was a bit envious of the middle-school teachers that also taught this subject. One of the software programs that they used for their classes was the Honestech Claymation Animation package. I always wanted a chance to play with it - but never got it. The classes I taught, we did 3D CGI animation and 2D flash-based animation. I think the main reason I was so interested in the stop-motion animation was due to my having attempted that sort of thing back in the mid-70's when I was a high school student (I was a big fan of the Gumby cartoons). Course back then you had to use super-8 film cameras and it took a lot of time and effort to get something good. Nowadays, with the software and technology available today - even young children can make some really neat videos and it doesn't have to cost a whole lot of money.

This software is very easy to use, the controls are very simplified and all you need besides the software is a computer and a webcam. I tried two different cameras, one a regular webcam (Logitech C615) and one of the U-create Games and Artimation devices. I had much better results with the HD webcam than I did with the low-resolution camera on the U-Create unit, but the results with the lesser camera really wasn't that bad. What you can do with these is limited to your imagination and what props and material you have on hand.

So, if you have some children who like to be creative and have a computer and a detachable webcam this would be the prefect summer activity (or winter) to keep them busy and maybe teach them something in the process. If you go that route, and want to be a bit educational - search the web for lesson plans and instructions handouts, like I mentioned there are teachers out there using software like this with their students.",I was really excited to find this software for the classroom. I had never used anything else except for the occasional cgi animation. I did have a great time using it. Today's technology is so good that I can use

When I switched to Mac, I started using Adobe Illustrator. CorelDRAW has always been the ONLY comparable product to Illustrator, and continues to be so with Suite X8. It's exclusively a Windows program, so if that's the environment you're working in, and you're looking to upgrade to a real graphics program, Suite X8 would be a great choice.

As with Illustrator, the learning curve is steep. This isn't one of those watered down vector art programs, this is the real deal, meant to give you powerful tools to create a variety of deliverables in unlimited formats. I won't waste space here listing the modules and what they do, since that's available in the above product description from Corel.  What I will make note of is the inclusion of AfterShot 2 as a built-in module that is exclusive with this release via Amazon.  AfterShot 2 gives you the same kind of photo editing power that you'll find in Photoshop, and most notably adds the ability to edit RAW files from nearly every known camera on the planet that will shoot in the RAW format.  If you don't know what RAW is, then you'll probably never use this feature, but for those who do, it's nice to know Corel has finally added the support for RAW images that have long been available in Illustrator.

THE PROS
*If you're already a CorelDRAW user, Suite X8 is a worthy upgrade.  Most of the user interface is identical, with a few enhancements, so you'll know your way around.  There's a free 30-day tutorial available online to get you up to speed on the new features and functions.
*This is a one-person license, but it's a permanent license with no other fees required.  Corel also has a subscription service if you want to ""rent"" CorelDRAW, similar to Adobe's Creative Cloud, if you don't want to pay the full retail price up front.  The subscription also includes free updates.
*CorelDraw will export and import native Adobe Illustrator files if you're moving from that platform, or also use Illustrator files, and prefer to continue to work in CorelDraw.
*As a vector creator/editor, CorelDRAW can match Illustrator feature-for-feature, even though it may do things differently than Illustrator, you can get the same things done. It really comes down to a matter of preference.

THE CONS
*You have to have an internet connection to activate the software, and to allow them to check your license at least once a month.  Not usually a problem since if you're reading this, you have internet access, but I find it a bit intrusive.  Just a small detail.
*While CorelDRAW is an outstanding vector art program, I find Photopaint to be an inferior cousin to Photoshop, and the website creator should be avoided altogether. Corel is trying to provide a ""value-added"" incentive by adding these other programs in a ""suite"" but I wouldn't buy CorelDRAW for its photo-editing capabilities.
*This is ONLY a Windows program. I've always wanted Corel to port DRAW over to the Mac.  If they had, I would still be using it and probably never have started with Illustrator, which then eventually drew me in to all of the related Adobe products.  That said, CorelDRAW does offer a robust export/import function to use files from other programs, but it's not as seamless as with Illustrator.

Just a reminder: This is NOT a program for newbies.  Even though Corel and everyone else touts the ease of use of their programs, there's a steep learning curve to programs like CorelDRAW and Illustrator when you reach this level of professional program.  But, don't be discouraged if you are new to this level.  You CAN learn the program, just give yourself time.

It's a powerful product, with a clean upgrade path to it's big brother. But it will be a very long time before I grow out of this one.

Here are my favorite features:

Motion Tracking: you can open a motion video (a camcorder video, for example), mark an object in the video, and Anime Studio will track that object through multiple frames. You can then use this marker to attach one of your animations. Imagine the possibilities: Animated characters can dance with your children on video-all you have to do is animate the character, then attach the animated character to your child in the video. Cool!

Lip Syncing: You can sync a characters lip movements to audio easily. This is pretty hard to do manually. Anime Studio has a command to take care of it. So the character dancing with your child can sing too!

Lots of Import options, including Photoshop. Anime Studio preserves Photoshop layers, which saves lots of time if you use Photoshop.

Finally, keep in mind that animations are not necessarily cartoons. Anytime you need a picture or text to move in a complex way on top of or below other pictures, you are doing animation. So there are business applications too (think product instructional videos with animations of parts interacting with other parts, with hatches opening and latches latching...you get the idea).

OK, now for my input device recommendation: Anime Studio has good drawing tools. Lots of animation work requires precise placement of points, drawing of paths, etc. You really want to use a tablet.

I don't know exactly, but I've been using it at least since the early nineties, so I've been using it almost from the start.

The school where I studied digital illustration, design and animation used mostly Adobe products on Macs. At the time, I'd take what I'd learned, go home, and then do the same thing with CorelDraw on my computer. I quickly discovered that there are two, maybe three, major differences between CorelDraw and those other programs.

1. CorelDraw Graphics Suite gives you several programs--like a vector-design program and a photo-manipulation program--in one and doesn't make you pay extra for filters and other features that should be included.

2. CorelDraw Graphics Suite is a lot cheaper than the full version of even one of those products. (Check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adobe-Photoshop-CS6/dp/B007R0RKV8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adobe Photoshop CS6</a>&nbsp;to compare, and remember that Photoshop doesn't include a vector-design program.)

3. Most other illustrators and graphic designers still prefer Adobe products. I have no idea why, but they often look down on CorelDraw.

The fact is that there's nothing you can do with those other programs that you can't do with CorelDraw Graphic Suites. I once met a woman who ran a design studio, and she told me all the designers who worked under her used Adobe products--but she preferred to fix their work in CorelDraw. We both agreed it was the better program.

Why would you want to pay more to get less?

If you're an illustrator or artist looking for something that does a better job of imitating brushes and the like, I'd recommend a different Corel product:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corel-Painter-12/dp/B004YHXXKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corel Painter 12</a>.

Several of my friends who are illustrators or cartoonists consider the CINTIQ with Corel Painter to be essential, but the CINTIQ is very expensive. Still, if you're an illustrator or artist and you want the best of the best, that would be the way to go.

CorelDraw Graphics Suite just keeps getting better and better (although one thing long-time users know is that you only buy the even-numbered versions, because the odd-numbered ones tend to be buggy). X6 is the best version yet. I would recommend it to any designer.",I was excited to get this illustrator from San Francisco who is the original cartoon designer from the early 90's and for some reason had to leave school for several years to get the job done.

I used VideoStudio 7, 9, X1, X2 plus, X3 Plus, and now X4 Ultimate. I also tried digital video softwares from Pinnacle, Roxio, Adobe Premiere. However, Corel software beats them for stability and easy of use. The Adobe Premiere is a great software, but it's overwhelming and overkill for most of us. In general, Corel's VideoStudio is less frustrating than any other softwares.

From product line point of view, Corel VideoStudio has all the basics, not a lot of bells and whistles that are hard to learn. The basic functions are easy to use and intuitive. You use the timeline to place video clips, then add transitions, background music, titles. After you are done, it can be easily exported to YouTube, FaceBook, Flicker...etc. Or you can burn your own DVD, or Blu-Ray disks.

Once a while, bad batch did occur (like Microsoft's Vista), the VideoStudio X3 was slow and crashed a lot. The VideoStuido X4 has significantly improvements. It integrates the disk authoring tool. So I don't need to run separate tool to burn DVD or Blu-ray disk. Also, VideoStudio X4 is extremely stable....I haven't run into any crash after several home video projects.

However, editing HD videos requires a very very powerful CPU, this is especially true if you are dealing with the highly compressed AVCHD videos. My system configuration is: Core i7 processor, 12 GB ram, Window 7 64-bit, 1GB video card, two SATA-2 drives. I have no problem to advance AVCHD videos frame by frame for precise editing, or to fast forward AVCHD videos for quick preview...etc. Also, the rendering time is fast. During rendering, my CPU usage can go up to 90%. If you feel frame drop, out-of-sync between audio and video, color bleaching, software is slow to response to mouse clicking, video editing process is not smooth...etc, before blaming VideoStudio software, you may want to check your hardware system first.

Here is one trick I learned from Video Magazine. While running the VideoStudio with you main hard drive (like C-drive), you should put all video files (both the video input files and video output files) in a separate hard drive. Doing so can ensure a better system performance. With my system, if I put all the video files in the C-drive where the main program resides, from time to time, the VideoStudio program will still hang (not response to your mouse) for couple of second (not crash). This hanging problem goes away once I put all videos files at a separate hard drive.

So far, I have done 4 home videos and created 4 AVCHD disks. I am very happy with the latest VideoStudio X4.

By the way, they don't include the bonus winZip pro software in the package. You have to download the winZip pro software from their web site. But the provided key does not work with the download winZip pro.

This is a one-year subscription to Office 365, which can be installed on one PC/MAC and one tablet/phone.

This includes all the standard office products: Word, Excel, OneNote, Access, PowerPoint, Publisher, and Outlook.

The only office product available for Android is OneNote. This used to be one of my favorite office products, but it's been really crippled by the move to integrate it across platforms. It's not nearly as flexible as it used to be. In the desktop version you can still create section groups, but they won't sync with the mobile version. You also can't add more space to pages the way you used to.

The other office products work as well as ever. I wish at least Word was available for Android, though. I guess Microsoft wants to push people toward their mobile OS, though.

I'm not a huge fan of subscription software in general. When I buy something, I want it to be mine. I didn't like having to setup a Microsoft account to use the software. I've been using OpenOffice for a long time and I don't anticipate fully switching to the Microsoft products. For one thing, the subscription runs out in a year. Also, I feel OpenOffice protects my privacy a lot better.

If you have to have office, then you have to have office. It Access and PowerPoint are definitely worth the price of the software, also.","I have been using this product for about 1 year.

It's always exciting to see what new features are added to old favorites, or to discover a totally new program that gives me new features or help me out.  However, with the new release of VideoStudio Pro X2 from Corel I can't see that many new features that interest me -- after using this for two months I am left with the question, ""Just WHY would I need to upgrade to this version?""

Of course the answer to that question is because of high definition video.  Good answer, but the truth of the matter is that HD is just not catching on -- yet.  It's technology that is slightly ahead of its time.  even Blu-Ray adoption is mediocre, as most people find that regular definition video is doing them just fine.  So when it comes to homemade video and productions one has to wonder what the big rush is to produce content in HD that will, in all likelyhood, be viewed on regular definition devices or uploaded to the 'net that will be compress it down to a more manageable size and form.

The program itself has many of the same features as the previous version, with the only real big change being added support for HD.  It's still got a lot of the quirks that the previous version had as well -- not exactly easy to use, and requires a lot of tinkering to get the basics down.  If you have anything short of a Core2 machine then you might want to pass this up as it will take a lot of processing power to convert videos and to use the program effectively.

Honestly, I would say that unless you have a burning desire to go HD you can get most of the features you will need for video editing from Windows Movie Maker -- a freebie from Microsoft.  No, you won't get all the bells and whistles -- but come on, how often do we use all those bells and whistles?  Most of us just want to store our home movies in a digital format.

The bottom line is this.  If you need HD, this is a good choice -- albeit it with a learning curve.  For the rest of us, stick with the older version and skip the upgrade or just use the free Windows Movie Maker.","I've used Tinker Bellows software since it launched, and I'm almost certain they will find the answer to my question.

2 - Bluray - it plays bluray video discs very well. I have played 8 discs, all from Netflix, and have not had a problem with any of them crashing.

3 - On-the-fly 3d conversion: I tried this function with picture files, bluray discs and standard DVD's.

I was fairly impressed at first, just because I've never used speech recognition software before, and it was a delight to see what I was saying (mostly) appearing on screen.

After playing around with it for a while, however, I don't think it would be the kind of software I would want to use regularly to compose documents.  When I'm typing, I watch the screen, and correct nearly all of my errors as they appear.  It's absolute torture for me to go through and proof my work after I've typed it.  Using speech recognition software regularly would force me to do so, since I'm less likely to catch the errors in real time.  Now, proofreading is a good skill to have, and a good habit to be in, but I _hate_ doing it, so anything that would make me have to do so (like a critical boss, or speech recognition software) is something I'm not eager to embrace (I don't actually make a habit of embracing any of my bosses, but that's neither here nor there).

So, if you're lazy like me, you'll be torn between the convenience of keeping your hands in your pockets (or busy ferrying junk food from the bag to your face) while you work, and the inconvenience of proofing your work after it's dictated.  For the diligent, I guess this software would let them dictate documents while doing chin-ups, or something, but that's a lifestyle (diligence, physical fitness) that I don't know much about and can't provide a lot of useful feedback on.","I was excited to get this product because it is so beautiful.

Before he died, Dirk buried his treasure for Frances to find using a series of hidden clues, and the treasure remains somewhere on ranch property.  Besides Shadow Ranch, Nancy gets to explore a canyon full of petroglyphs, a Native American shop, a ghost town, and abandoned cave dwellings.

There are a number of suspects: Dave the ranch hand, Tex the head wrangler, Shorty the cook, and Mary Yazzie, a Native American jeweler. Nancy meets other characters over the phone, including a famous novelist, the local sheriff, and the Rawleys.

Several new features have been added, including a larger game window, which I liked, although navigating a full inventory could be confusing at times.  Nancy gets to learn about horses, barrel racing and how to use a lariat.  To get from place to place (there are six major locations), Nancy rides Bob the quarter horse.  Nancy can search for information on the web with her cell phone, which provides numerous hints as to how to solve puzzles. There is a strong educational element here, as Nancy sifts through information on not only ranch life (cattle branding, barrel racing, picking vegetables, feeding horses), but numerous other topics (knitting, agates, petroglyphs, flowers).

I liked the nature of the puzzles, although many reviewers complained about the repetitive chores, including daily egg collecting, vegetable picking, cake baking, and feeding the animals.  Nancy is expected to help out during her visit by performing tasks for various characters, including putting together a bridle, collecting eggs and vegetables, arranging a jewelry display, and collecting arrowheads.  There are a fair number of slider puzzles and several mazes. This game is more difficult than others in the series but not as hard as Secret of Blackmoor Manor.

Secret of Shadow Ranch had a very strong story, good character development, excellent music (Spanish guitar, country western, scary music in the ghost town that will make the hair stand up on the back of your neck), improved graphics, well integrated puzzles, and a satisfying conclusion (which I didn't find in Secret of Blackmoor Manor).  Plenty of romance and suspense for young sleuths!",I was excited to get my hands dirty after the recent outing at the Ritz-Carlton in Mexico. I had never seen a rattlesnake before.

The most significant chance is you have to pay to have the tax format tables work. Previous editions of Sage have always given the user the option to enter their tax information manually.

The basic look and function of the program is so similar to Quickbooks, in fact, that one could easily mistake it for the current king of the hill.

To test this product, I set up books for a small business that I recently started and entered a number of basic transactions.  While some processes weren't as intuitive as I might have liked, it's relatively user friendly and it doesn't take long to get things done.  Like Quickbooks, the internal controls are awful and you can freely edit past transactions with no real audit trail.  This is convenient if you make a mistake, but a major no-no for those trying to run a genuine accounting department.

Office Accounting Professional is a competent program for those running a mom and pop business, but would not be sufficient for any more than that.  Unfortunately, I didn't see anything here that is a real improvement over Quickbooks and because of that, I don't recommend the product.  Because Quickbooks enjoys a near-monopoly in this market, there are several advantages to buying it.  Many bookkeepers and tax preparers will be able to take a copy of your data file and do their work, but none of them are likely to have this product.

Now, I must admit upfront that I have little or no prior experience with spreadsheet applications. My basic numbers calculations have been done in programs like Quicken and the analog pen and paper method. I think in the past I may have opened up Excel or tried to use Apple's AppleWorks spreadsheet program, but not only did the programs look boring, but I had no idea where to begin in using these applications.

Leave it to Apple, however, to create yet another useful production program for the rest of us. That is, a program which is intuitive, practical, and stylish. Numbers '08 is another fine program that can help you transform the analog fashion of pen and paper calculations and create functions that can help you become more efficient with various projects involving money, data gathering and calculations.

Already I see a number of projects that I can create or improve upon using Numbers '08. For example, for the last couple of years I've been keeping a simple photography equipment inventory list in my business binder. When I make a new $[...]+ purchase I make note of it in my list. But with Numbers '08, I can streamline that data and keep a running balance on how much I've spent on equipment. Likewise, I can use the same technique for creating a better marketing plan, an equipment needs budget, a business growth plan, a couple of simple to-do check lists for long terms projects, and a few custom invoices for freelance work I do. In fact, I've already re-designed my wedding client contract using Numbers '08 so that I can use it on my laptop and fill it in right after the close of a sale. This type spread sheet method is more accurate and less time consuming than the paper format.

The templates that come installed with Numbers '08 provide a list of other possibilities that include various financial budgets plans, a home improvement plan, an event planner, grade book, and a science research report.

As with Apple's Pages and Keynote, Numbers '08 is also a graphic design application. It contains tools for adding various font styles, shapes, photos, and other media. In other words, you have the ability to tell a visual story with your facts, figures, and data.

If you have no prior experience with spread sheet creation or if you want to learn the features of Numbers '08, Apple has produced an excellent set of tutorial videos to get you up and running. The 286-page Numbers User Guide is also another useful source for getting started and learning the program.

The most challenging part for those of us new to spreadsheet development is understanding how formulas work in a table setup so that calculations can be made. Numbers '08 comes installed with over 150 formulas that will perform most all the calculations that we'll ever need. But the basic mathematical functions that you learned in high school should be enough to get your started. Basically, a formula simply provides the sum of selected cells in a table. Again, the Apple tutorial or User Guide and the installed templates will show you some really easy steps for basic functions. From there, you can study and create formula functions to fit your individual needs.

Already a third-party website called Numbers Templates has been created to share templates, tips, and tricks for using the Numbers '08 spreadsheet program.

Though I can't compare Numbers '08 with the industry standard program like Excel, Apple's program I think will fit the needs of most home and small business users. No doubt, future versions will include even more advance functions, but as with Apple's other fine programs, Numbers '08 has the simplicity and style that we've all come to expect.

Every year, Turbotax charges more and offers less - and if you read the many comments here, you'll see that they went WAY over the top this time around with their attempt to charge users another $9.95 for each additional return printed by the software.

Let's be clear about something: each year's Turbotax is a DISPOSABLE product that will get used once or twice, and then discarded when the next year comes around. That already makes the ""per use"" charge higher than ANY other software I own. More than MS Office, more than Final Cut Pro.

Owing to lack of competition (Taxcut offers no Home & Business version for Mac users), Intuit charges sky high prices and offers no significant tech support. And now, the software largely forces you to use eFile (not ""free,"" but another reason the cost has climbed) making it easier - and therefore more likely - for the IRS to decide to audit you.

If Intuit really cared about their customer base and treated them right, they'd have a money pump: I know I'd buy every year, and so would most Mac users. But instead, every year brings new problems, new limitations, new raises in price...and the same old contempt.

By the way, users reading these reviews should know that many (MANY!) one-star reviews were removed after Intuit made some conciliatory changes to their price structure in response to outraged customers. Otherwise, the combined star rating would be even worse than it is now.

Sorry, Intuit, I've had it. I'm gone.

UPDATE Feb 2008

Okay, I caved and bought TT just to stay consistent with previous years (though I found it for about $50 less than what Intuit wanted me to pay for it). Even so, I've been hugely disappointed that the program just doesn't work as well as in previous years.

Owing to (needless) interface changes, it seems that whole categories of expenses and deductions get skipped unless you go back to find them manually. The program then helpfully double-entered all my investment dividends, giving me the opportunity to pay twice the necessary tax.

Additionally frustrating was the fact that TT repeatedly failed to help me enter or calculate taxes, but instead simply told me that I'd need to contact the IRS for publications and forms. This is NOT what I expect from Intuit's most expensive tax product - and it's especially unacceptable in that I'm preparing a very uncomplicated return (funny how a lack of income will do that, huh?)

I'll wait until after tax time to see if I can pick up a dirt cheap copy of TaxCut, and give it a try. Unless it stinks on ice, that's what I'll be using instead of TurboTax in the future.",I spent the last 15+ years trying to find something worth doing and I was finally able to do so.

Chances are that your experiences were not entirely positive. While offering some clear value to us, they normally come preloaded on computers and bombard you with notifications and updates, while draining valuable system resources (I HATE THAT don't you?). As such, these programs have gotten a reputation for being bloated and inefficient, while free antivirus offerings, like AVG and Avast, have proven themselves to be worthy alternatives, at least for core features.

Strengths: Good at scanning for viruses and malware. Tons of features, easy to use.  Report and monitor internet attempts/ Hits on your PC. Pretty bells sounds and graphs.

Weaknesses: Terrible load times and slow to respond. Kept crashing after roughly 9 months of use - customer service was terrible. Can bog down system though not as bad as Norton Internet security suite. Nightmare to update, renew, and if something goes wrong, another nightmare to uninstall. Poor Tech support.

Overall Evaluation: If you can get it to load, and get it to respond (even on a fairly quick computer it took forever), then it's a decent protection package. However, if you really don't know a lot about protection programs or have a very short temper when it comes to computers, I suggest staying away - this package causes headaches and so does customer support.

My Final Opinion On Windows 8
=============================

I've plugged in the Windows 7 drive to access things on it, and I really don't want to plug the Windows 8 drive back in (even though I could simply take the cables out of one and put them into the other directly below it). Windows 8 really is a lame operating system; it should come in both desktop and handheld device versions, not a hybrid all-purpose version, but that's just my opinion. I gave it a fair chance...I got ""used"" to it...and still, I think it's a horrible implementation. I feel like I'm working from one convenient location again.

=============
Previously...
=============

I just need to add one more edit. My install is still fresh, yet I've come to a snag that has brought my system to a screeching halt. I'm unable to boot up at this point, and although it says ""Preparing Automatic Repair,"" no repairs are taking place. Enough trying to look for the good in Windows 8. It really is garbage. The start screen is stupid, and it has no place on a desktop machine. I guess it's time to install everything from scratch again, but that's okay, since I didn't get around to installing more than a couple of programs before this happened anyway. So lame.

I drop it down to one star, because the description for one star is considered ""I hate it,"" and I do. Even if this was working without incident, that when a product works as expected, that doesn't count toward an opinion of the OS. It really has been unproductive, inconsistent, inefficient and quite unnecessary in regards to what it has to offer.

==============
Prior Opinion:
==============

I like the operating system now that I turned the house upside down looking for my upgrade path. I haven't had a single issue with performance.

There are things I think need much refinement with Windows 8, and all of it has to do with the transitional elements. Though I've figure out where the options are that I wanted to manipulate, it was nowhere near being an intuitive process. The new Start Screen is like sitting on the internet all day; you get all the pointless fluff you would browse through on the internet, all in one place; only now instead of doing it at your convenience, your online presence is announced to the world the moment you log in to Windows 8.

I have the internet, but I don't keep important files on the computers that are connected - I only goof around on this [Windows 8] one. So what does this mean for our work computers? I'm not sure yet, as those are still on previous versions, but I've got to wonder what good live tiles are going to be on a computer that isn't linked to the world.

One common annoyance is when I go for the top of the scroll bar on the right side of any scrolling window, the charms menu pops out and is quite distracting.

Anyway, this is a great operating system for goofing around.

I bought this and opened it before Amazon added ""- UPGRADE"" to the title. Yes I read the upgrade notes, but I figured it was a message indicating that if I choose to upgrade a current installation, that my programs and their settings would remain intact after the process; there was no indication that I could not do a clean install on a new hard drive. I thought it was a great deal at almost seventy dollars being offered to entice those of us early-adopters who may be holding off because of all the updates and downloads that would be needed down the road. Well, it's still seventy dollars. Had they just put that down as the MSRP, I would have questioned it being a full version.

Although it has been made clear since, I am still stuck with an upgrade disk, which so far I'm not getting to use. Under normal circumstances I wouldn't ding a product that I haven't used, but I zoomed in on the pictures to make sure it was a full version and I didn't see ""Upgrade"" marked on the packaging, and that is Microsoft's fault, so yes, this product gets one star from me.

I have searched for a full version, and still this comes up as the most expensive Win 8 Pro at the MSRP of $199.99 - why would anyone have thought this isn't the full version?

ramito | version | sell | upgrade | software | bundle | program | price | consider | look | purchase | decision | buy | note | community | application | expense | ons,"As ramito mentioned, it's important to know which version Amazon is selling. I have version 3.5 and it required a paid upgrade to 3.6 or the current 4.2.1 version. I also have this latest version only since it was included as part of a Mac software bundle.
RapidWeaver is no longer a $50 program, since its price increased to $79. Upgrades from 3.5 are $30. This is without considering additional expenses for Themes, Plugins, Utilities, etc.

For $79, I would strongly recommend that potential buyers take a look at Sandvox Pro by Karelia, or Freeway Express by Softpress. Don't base your purchase decision on how this compares to iWeb, since pretty much any program is superior to iWeb.
I use Freeway Pro, and if I didn't I would seriously consider Sandvox or Freeway Express before buying RapidWeaver.

On a positive note, the RapidWeaver community is indeed helpful and RapidWeaver is a popular application. It's just overpriced considering the available alternatives and the expense of Add-ons as mentioned before.
Amazon's price of $42.49 is definitely more attractive than $79, but still not something I would pay for this program.","I am so disappointed that AstraSoft discontinued this version because this is the only software that is available to me now.

It has a learning curve but very exciting and a joyful one.

A big difference between version 3.5 and 4 is the omission of Soundtrack (similar to Garageband but designed for videographers) audio software; but at the same time the price was slashed from $299 to $199.

FCE is a nondestructive video editing program.  Clips in Final Cut Express are just pointers to the original source material and do not affect the source files themselves in your original footage on your hard drive. It can also import multiple formats and merge it in a project; DV, AVCHD, and even NTSC or PAL.

It might be worthy of upgrading from 3.5 if you have the new AVCHD camera.  Otherwise, you may want to think again.

In addition to a new look, it offers stability, ease of use and more Internet integration than ever before.
Installation was easy. You can either upgrade your existing Windows or do a clean install. I recommend a clean install so be sure to back up your important data (e-mail, accounting programs, etc.) You can boot from the CD and it will pretty much to the rest. Installation takes about 30-60 minutes but it was VERY easy. XP really knows what plug and play means. ALL, and I mean ALL of my peripherals were found and configured automatically.
Once installed, you will be prompted to activate. This was an easy and fast process. The next thing it will do is set up your Internet access. Once this is done, you are now ready to go. You will notice right away that the interface is different and very colorful. It may take a little while to get used to but once you do, you will like it. You also have an option of a ""classic"" Windows 9x view.
Windows XP makes a lot of functions very easy. First of all, depending on your BIOS and motherboard, you can tell Windows just what to do when you press your power button. It also has built in CD burning capability, however, to delete a file from a CD-RW, you must erase the CD and then put back the files you want. A little inconvenient but a lot more stable than DirectCD. It is VERY easy to set up individual users. You can set up a personalized account for each member of the family. Also, when installing many programs, it will detect XP and ask if you want certain people to access the program. This is very nice and secure. And with Internet Explorer 6.0, you can now choose the level of cookie protection. You will be amazed on how many third party ""usage tracking"" cookies that are placed on your PC.
Backward compatibly is very good to excellent with XP. XP ran all of my older windows based programs and MOST of my DOS games. A few DOS games worked about 80% and some not at all. I am sure that ""DOS EMULATORS"" will be available for purchase in the near future.
Windows XP seemed designed for Internet integration. Just about every major function in XP has a tie to the Internet. And because of this, Microsoft has included a built in Firewall. It is good, but I would recommend Norton Internet Security 2002.
For those of you who are worried about compatibility, Windows XP makes it pretty easy to set up a dual boot. All you need is a partition created before installing. After that, Windows does the rest.
For those who want security, go with Windows XP Professional. Everyone else can get by with Windows XP Home. If you have a previous copy of Windows, get the UPGRADE version. It will search for a previous install or ask you for the original Windows 9.x/2000 disk to verify.
There is a lot more I can say about Windows XP but you just need to see it for yourself. If you want stability, awesome Internet integration and overall easy of use, you must get this upgrade.","I'm going to try this again, if I get a chance, I can probably find it somewhere else.

I'd seen really good reviews for this game, but I was still kind of apprehensive because it's such an old game, I thought the graphics would be really horrible. But I was surprised at what a quality game it is! I'm going to split my review up into different sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.

PLOT - 4.5/5: Nancy's ski vacation is cut short when a blizzard keeps her stuck in the Wisconsin castle she's staying at. Apparently in the 1920's, some guy who really loved French castles decided to build one in Wisconsin, and even imported a tower from Marie Antoinette's castle to be added on to his. Nancy learns that Marie Antoinette was rumored to have left a treasure somewhere in the castle, so it's up to her to find the treasure before someone else tears the castle apart trying to find it. I thought this was a really good plot, and everything else into the story tied into it nicely. I only wish it had been longer, it was a little shorter than I had hoped. But overall, I was impressed!

CHARACTERS - 3.5/5: The characters include the castle's caretaker, Dexter, who is very defensive and has a dark past, and Jacques, a famous French skier who was actually really fun to listen to. The hotel's guests were Professor Hotchkiss, an eccentric old woman who studies French history, and Lisa, a photojournalist. Each of the characters had their own personalities and motives, which was good. The voice acting was good, too. My only problem was that the culprit was really obvious, like 20 minutes into the mystery I could tell who it was. That really bothered me, so I'm going to have to knock off a couple of points for it.

SETTING - 5/5: I loved the castle!! It was huge, I got lost plenty of times just trying to find my hotel room, haha. But there was tons to explore. Plus I was surprised how good the graphics were. I thought they might be kind of shabby because it's an older game, but I was way off. And the music was really nice, some of the best music I've heard in a Nancy Drew game.

PUZZLES - 3/5: I felt there was a serious lack of puzzles in this game. Maybe this came out before Her Interactive got the idea of putting in ""filler puzzles"" to make the games longer. It was kind of nice not having to do a puzzle every second, but I do want to have SOME puzzles. There were probably less than a handfull of puzzles in the whole game, wich must have been why it was so short.

IS IT CHALLENGING?: No. Like I said before theres only a few puzzles, and everything else is pretty easy. I'd give it a 2 for challenge.

ENDING - 5/5: The ending was good. It made perfect sense with the rest of the plot. The culprit isn't a surprise, but catching them was fun.

FINAL SCORE:
Plot: 4.5
Characters: 3.5
Setting: 5
Puzzles: 3
Challenge: 2
Ending: 5
= 23 divided by 6 = 3.8 rounded to 4.",I bought this for my 2nd time and it is still the best selling item on the market. I had no idea it had any real value for me when it came to rating a ski vacation. The problem is no longer there. I

My primary reason for preferring WP over Word is that it is much easier to format documents and to fix stuff when it goes wrong.

The main reason to use Word is because everyone else uses it. The main reason to use WordPerfect is that it is the best word processor out there.

A few notes on WPX7:

I installed it on a Win7 laptop. It took about five minutes to run the installation. I only  installed WP and Lightning, not the spreadsheet and presentation programs, so it would take longer if you installed all of them. Everything worked immediately--no problems, no crashes, nothing.

The installation program will ask if you want to move settings from a previous WP installation to the new version and if you want to delete the old installation. It makes life easy when you upgrade.

The programs may be installed on up to three PCs.

It does not include a few features found in the Standard and Professional versions, such as the ability to edit PDFs, ebook creation software and disk burning software. It also does not include the Paradox database program that is only available in the Pro version.

I evaluated it simply to see what the quality of the product was; I am already an intermediate level Mandarin speaker (native English speaker).

Rosetta Stone has one core thing right: the principle that you learn a foreign language best by avoiding ""translation"" in your head.  It is much better to learn Chinese by seeing a picture of an apple and saying/hearing ""pingguo"" than it is to look at it and think ""apple"" in English and trying to translate to Chinese.  In this regard, their method is effective.

Where this program is lacking, however, is in not teaching the Chinese characters.  It sounds strange to English speakers, but it really is true that learning the characters is absolutely essential to learning to speak the language well.  (I resisted this at first too, but luckily a college professor saved me from my wrong thinking).  I would love to Rosetta add an option in the software that allows you to learn the characters as an intrinsic part of learning the language.

If you're just trying to learn to be conversant, and don't want to learn the characters, and prefer not to be tied to your computer, I find the Pimsleur CDs to be a better option.

Overall- good program - but don't fall for the hype that learning Chinese is going to be easy.

Both operate on Windows XP, and have specs well above what the stated requirements are on the McAfee box. I've never been a fan of any security software and have used my computers unprotected for many years with no problems, but I figured it was time to upgrade. I've tried Norton, Panda, and a variety of other software and wound up uninstalling them after a few days.

My gripe with the McAfee software is that there is an obvious slow-down in both of my computers, more so with the laptop. The installation process was also painfully slow, and now I feel like there's a new update to upload every single day.

On the positive side, the scanning process was pretty quick; McAfee located 1 potential problem, and asked me if I wanted to remove it. It's It's great that this is an 8-in-1 protection, so there's no need to go out and buy additional products that may or may not work together. My favorite part so far has been the McAfee Site Advisor, which I feel makes web surfing much safer.

Having used this software for a couple days, it's too early to tell if there are any kinks, but so far everything is functioning well.

A week later: while uploading an update, there was some sort of a glitch, and I was instructed to re-install the program. Tedious..

The Classic Shell can be customized for further improvement, but just using it as installed makes Windows 8 as easy as Windows 7, plus you have the touch screen capabilities. The email program will still be poor. However, you can buy Office 2010, which works fine on Windows 8. Most of your other applications will also work just the way they used to work.  Microsoft really screwed up with the Windows 8 interface, and the upcoming Windows 8.1 is not much better.  While not saying it in so many words, a Microsoft spokesperson took 10 minutes to say that users should quit complaining and get used to it. Bottom line, I hated Windows 8 as it came with my new ultrabook. I could barely get it to work where I could do anything productive. With the new shell installed, Win 8 works quite well indeed. If Microsoft had done the shell, I'd give it 5 stars and get used to the new paradigm.

I've used various video products over the years, including Pinnacle and a variety of free ones, and based on that experience, really like the interface and ease of use of VideoStudio Pro X8.

The power of VideoStudio Pro X8 is that you can relatively quickly come up to speed (there is a learning curve, just to understand the icons and terminology) and do basic video manipulation of a camera or phone video.  And then, there is a lot of room for growth as your skills and experience expand.  VideoStudio Pro X8 also comes with a nice set of images, videos, and sound tracks that you can start with and then expand upon on your own.  This makes doing simple things to liven up your video much easier.

I am a sporadic user of video software.  I will get onto a personal project with family video or something, and will immerse myself into the tool, explorer the capabilities, and then when done, not come back video editing for months.  VideoStudio Pro X8 is easy enough to just use, but it takes a bit to get use to the fine details of the interface and knowing how to shortcut the process.  My only want here is to take the time to put a little info link (i) by all the functionality screens and provide a sentence or two of explanation.

VideoStudio Pro X8 has more capabilities to it than most people will use.  There's an analogy I like to use for products like this.  This product is like the Microsoft Office products (Word, Excel, PowerPoint).  Each of those products are really easy to use and get work down.  When most people use the products for work or home typical usage, they are only scratching the surface of what the product is capable of.  Until you need it, and if you do, its there.  Seems to me that VideoStudio Pro X8 is the same.","I have been using this product since it launched, back several months ago. I was pleased and surprised that the product offered so many options for user convenience and ease of use. I was amazed that the speed of the camera and my learning curve was"

It's extremely quick, which really is a nice change (recent models have been faster, but I'm still flinching from the PaintShop versions of yore that made you feel like you were watching paint dry, waiting for them to load.)

This version, though, does have more than a bit of a learning curve, even for people who have used the product before. It's definitely high end for getting results from  your photo manipulation. I haven't spent as much time on this as I should, but because I'm familiar with the company's software, it's not completely unfamiliar.

I also think the price is decent for the level of sophistication. This is a very nice set up.

It's fairly similar to Adobe Premiere in layout, so if you're used to that but don't want to either shell out for Premiere or step down to Premiere Elements, it'll be decently familiar (as functionality goes, it's smack in the middle of the two). I did find it a bit sluggish with a rather excessive collection of title and effects templates; it really is possible to have too much of a good thing, and learning to navigate the asset browser takes a little longer than I'd like.

Overall, the price is right, the learning curve isn't too bad, and although you won't rave about it, it works fine for basic to intermediate editing tasks.",I love Layout and its functionalities. It is really nice for a quick clean up and the smackdown is great. It cuts across the board and cuts across the sections. It's really nice to have such a
game | play | flip | time | favorite | series | character | history | exploring | bit | area | castle | ton | inspiration | look | introduction | treasure | classic,"I might be biased about this game because it was the first I ever played (and the first I ever finished -- since, when I started playing, I had all of the first five that I was flipping between, and six and seven came out very close on the heels of them, so I didn't actually finish any until a while after I'd received them).

However, biases aside, this game still holds as my all-time favorite. I will admit it isn't the best game in the series, but that's ok by me. It isn't extremely difficult, but it isn't overly easy. The characters are all interesting (and this game introduces my favorite ND character, Professor Hotchkiss). I love history, and this game is full of that. But the best part about it? The exploring. I will admit that the movements are a little bit limited, but this is only the fourth game. They hadn't yet refined things. However, in this game, every time you progress (almost) you get to unlock a new area in the game. There are so many places to go in this little castle, so many things to see.  This game gave me so much to imagine, so much to think on, and, now that I'm older, it gives me a ton of inspiration.

To anyone that hasn't played this game, I highly recommend it. If you've played other games but not this one, I'm completely shocked. You need to play this game NOW. And if you're looking for an introduction to the series, look no further.

Toast will copy audio and video files as well as legal audio and video discs reliably and quickly (Toast 8 does so faster than Toast 6 and really ramps up the graphics).  And give Roxio credit for once again providing a hard-copy manual for this edition.

But Spin Doctor 2 is still Spin Doctor 2.  It's fairly accurate in sensing the tracks in an LP.  And conversion is relatively problem-free providing you don't start fooling with the filters.  Perhaps the problem of ""cleaning up"" those distorted, snap-crackle-pop vinyl discs is the same with any program.  For every gain, there's a loss--in frequencies, presence, naturalness.  I've found that it's not worth the hours of experimentation, though others may appreciate the feature, or know how it compares with similar programs.

The main problem with Spin Doctor becomes evident upon trying to edit, say, an hour-long radio broadcast.  Why Roxio would leave this bundled program unattended for the past several upgrades is a mystery.  I have yet to hear of anyone who actually found the bright and colorful wave formations practical for any sort of editing. Even when editing by the clock instead of the visual wave, it's impossible to attain precision accuracy.  Finally, unlike some other programs for recording FM analog programs to computer, Spin Doctor does not yet have a timer for starting an automated recording.

Unfortunate, because Toast is a user-friendly program, but if you're a Mac person looking for Cool-Edit precision plus automatic start, the comparably-priced Sound Edit is probably the best bet.  I'm presently dependent on iTunes, Toast 8, and Sound Edit.  With any luck, maybe by the time Toast 9 or 10 arrives, two will be plenty.","I was really disappointed that AstraSoft discontinued this program because I couldn't find it.

Ever since Windows XP, after all, Microsoft has included a built in zip manager.  The trouble is that while this basic zip management exists, it really is not all that good.  It opens and it makes zip files.

For those who deal with lots of files and find that compressing and combining files into zip folders is a regular task, I heartily recommend WinZip 14.  It is very easy to use, and provides significantly more compression than other programs I have used. It also offers much better security options, and overall has made my file management tasks and emailing significantly easier.

Turbo Tax helps make sure I don't miss something. After a full pass through the whole tax process it offers a review to ensure there isn't something I left out.

I used to use a tax attorney but realized I was doing all the work by bringing all my paperwork to him, then he would interview me and pass the results onto a service that would enter the data (probably into something like Turbo Tax). One year I found a big tax deduction that the attorney forgot to ask about. At that point I dumped the whole idea of having someone else do my taxes. I had found this big deduction using Turbo Tax.

Turbo Tax gets better and easier to use each year. Make sure you load the latest updates. This year the update even included a user interface improvement that fixed something I didn't like, so others must have complained.

Update December 2008: While improvements to the user interface are sometimes needed I find Intuit seems to make large changes each year which are not necessary. Change for change sake is not desirable. Functional improvements are appreciated, but changing a product so much that I only use once a year forces me to go through a new learning process each year.","I am an employee and have stockpiled bonds that are good enough to pay for themselves.

I am a fairly sophisticated software user, and used to do some programming myself, but had never really ventured into these type of painting/art programs.

Bottom Line: I was blown away by this program, totally impressed!!

Why?

#1 It's easy to use out of the box--- many of the controls are easy enough to figure out just by using them, it installs easy on both Mac and PC systems (I installed the program on both an old eMac and a low end Vista laptop successfully).

#2 It's really powerful--- once you really get into the software, it's amazing all the different brushes and textures and effects that you can do to make really impressive art.

#3 The tutorials are first rate--- A thick instruction manual that actually is well written, and actually teaches you about basic principles of art and painting.  There are also a whole series of video tutorials included free.  You can tell that a lot of hard work and frankly a lot of love went into this, which is a rarity for computer software these days.

#4 It's a great value--- For all you get, the price is very reasonable.  And check the company's website, if you're still not sold they were at the time of this writing offering a 60 day free downloadable trial.

One more tip:  Get even a low-price graphics tablet to go along with the software--- you'll be glad you did!","I was looking for a program that will actually run my computer and I couldn't find it.

It's easy to use and has an elegant interface.

  The quick fix feature is a one-touch photo correction tool that amateurs like. One click and the picture is ready to post or print. Corel's quick fix is remarkably good for most photos.

  You can also fine tune the brightness, highlights, shadows, and sharpness manually or have the program suggest settings and then tweak them as you desire. What is missing here (and in Picasa) is true adjustment of color.

  On the first time use, it scans EVERY image on the drives. You couldn't stop it! You have to wait for the program to finish. This is no good, but not terrible.

  In general, this software is pretty light on features and heavy demand on computer resources. For example, you can not resize or sharpen an image. And you can not change white balance/color cast, color space or printer profiles.

Pros:
* Easy to use
* Versions for iPhone (and iPod touch, iPad), Android and Windows
* There is an Outlook add-in
* Uses built-in compression for faster speed
* Option to password protect individual files
* By clicking on ""Files"" you can see who you have sent files to and see if they have downloaded the file

Cons:
* You have to install the software
* There are no install options, other than deciding if you want a desktop icon
* There is no drag and drop for adding files; you have to click the Browse button to add files
* The software does not support importing contacts from other online or local address books, but you can do this via the SendStuffNow website
* If you try to send more than one file, your files are rolled into one compressed zip file. When the receiver downloads the zip file, SendStuffNow does not offer to unzip the enclosed files.
* When you send a file, you have to wait for that file to upload to the server before you can start the process for another file
* The subject line of the email is [your name] has sent you a file. You can't change the subject
* It was slow to indicate when a person had downloaded a file
* Once or twice I clicked the box to also send the email to me, and I didn't receive the email (and it did not go to a spam folder)
* I sent a file to my wife and she said the download was slow. She has a high speed internet connection and a 45 MB file took 25 minutes to download. That's about as fast as a 256K DSL line.
* Another friend told me, ""The download was going very slowly, so I tried to download some of the files simultaneously and the files were not completely downloaded.""

I thought for the price I would take a chance on Tax Cut. It was after all a substantial price difference.

Right away I though the learning curve for TaxCut was a little steeper & it seemed I had to actually do some thinking when it was asking me questions. (Oh Darn!) The phraseology was slightly confusing but not overwhelming.

However, I got through it, the return was correct & it wasn't so difficult that I will go back to TT next year. I think TT is a better product that seems to have been thought out more, but that could be that TT has been around for much longer, I believe.

It was far better than any others I have used before. Now my wife and I have tablets as well, so the 360 for 5 devices was perfect.  It works on PCs, Macs, or Android devices (iOS devices get partial protection).

Installation was almost automatic. The license lets you install the software from their website with just one key. You can then manage all protected devices from your online account and move protections around as your collection of devices changes.

Norton 360 offers a password management feature, which is really handy. This feature stores usernames, passwords and credit card numbers and then fills in the information when opening your password-secured websites. That is very convenient if you have several online accounts.

Additional PC features include tune-up, backup and restore utilities. Norton includes a proprietary two-way PC firewall. Windows already comes with a firewall, but some people like the idea of having their firewall and anti-malware software come from a single source. The PC Tuneup cleans up Windows temporary files, Internet Explorer temporary files, Internet Explorer history cleanup, startup manager, registry cleanup and disk optimization.

The PC portion includes parental controls management. You can block access to sites that you don't want kids to visit and you can track where they go on the internet.

 The Safe Search Toolbar installs automatically so you can search safely right from your browser. There are plenty of search toolbars available.  I like having one that matches my PC security package.

Bottom line: Easy to install and covers just about everything I need.  What more could I ask for?","I ran my ios for security and ran into problems with my wife's ios running my computer. She was happy with the installation, and I have no idea why they don't have any keygens."

You are basically only getting 4 disks in an over-sized red cardboard box. For the price paid, I expected this thing to leap tall buildings in a single bound.  They could have at least given me a few jewel cases to store the disks!

There isn't even a ""back"" button I can click to hear things repeated.  You have to go back to the menu every time.  If there is a simpler way, it is not intuitive.

The promised ""pod casts"" or whatever they are called don't work with iphone or blackberry. Huge disappointment! They only mention that in the very fine print on their web page.

The first 10 minutes of the disk is listening to someone drone on and on about how great Fluenz is, and how masterful they are at teaching.  I already bought the package, so why use up my time with more self-indulgent back-patting?

I expected this to be fun, like they said.  If watching someone talk to you with just a plain black background is fun for you, you'll be thrilled.  In this day of CGI, and all the other tremendous tools there are out there for creating instructions, I was pretty disappointed by the lame graphics.  Oh, occasionally they change the background, and put a photo-shopped person in to indicate who you hear talking. They don't move, they just stand there like a cardboard cut-out.

I was hoping to use this as a teaching aid for my middle-school aged kids also, but they were so bored by it I couldn't get them to sit through even one lesson with me.

The software claims it will teach in a totally different way than what you learned in school.  I don't know where they went to school, but what I've seen so far is nearly identical to the way I learned foreign languages in school; learning to listen to conversations first, then going over the meaning, grammar and pronunciation afterward.",I received this dvd because I was a kid.

Of course Intuit is the monopoly and TurboTax is an Intuit product.  Why did all my other Mac Address book addresses blink in and out as I typed my registration name?  Even when I wasn't typing, the field kept on blinking.  It was as though Intuit was uploading all the names in the addressbook.  Then, when I looked for the use agreement, I couldn't find it to see if I had somehow agreed to give them my addressbook names???

Moving along, the TurboTax program's wording was better but still bad, leaving customers in the dark, even if we could read. The program crashed repeatedly while trying to copy my files to CD so it really can't do that.  Other than that, it was a little faster and easier, I suppose due to more interaction with the Feds and California.  Was my return right?  I doubt it.

I, myself have a number, including two cell phones, and ipod touch and ipad, several android devices (including a few Amazon Fire tablets), a dash-cam in my car, and a couple of the small action cameras. Not to mention some regular style camcorders and a digital point-and-shoot camera that can take videos. I was given a drone for Christmas that had a video camera  but it now lives in the top of a tree somewhere in a Louisiana bayou (story for another time). Plus, I'm slowly working on transferring old VHS tapes to digital format. So I was happy to try out this new version of Magix Movie Edit Pro 2016 for the past thirty days. I've been using an older version of similar software from another brand (Corel VideoStudio Pro X3) and wanted to tryout something newer.

Installation was typical for a software package like this, and you need to activate the software and register it at the company's website (you'll need to set up an user account). The package also comes with a code that gets you some bonus content. I had problems with getting that. There really isn't any clear instructions as what to do with the code. I went out to the CATOON web site and couldn't figure out where to input the code. Doing a little research I finally figured out that you had to access the website through the web portal inside the software itself. Then I had the problem of how exactly to do that  the icon/button isn't marked very clearly (IMO). But I eventually found it (upper right-hand corner of the screen, black square with the letters CO and a blue dot inside the O). Since I had already set up an account with the Catoon store all I had to do is put in the code and check out. Make sure that the amount shown is $0.00 otherwise there was something wrong with the code. At first I was a  bit underwhelmed with the downloaded content, but after taking a better look at it  I changed my mind. You get three folders of stuff,  Videos, Songs, and Sound Fx. For the video, you get ten short abstract video pieces ranging from 5~27 seconds in length. You can use these for a variety of things. Songs, you get twenty pieces of music, and for Sound FX you get forty various generic sound effects. Not a whole lot of stuff, but some pieces that might come in handy. You can look around the Catoon store while you're there and check out some of the free stuff, but be aware  there is licensing on all the content there for the specific usage of the material. Be sure to first check to see what you're agreeing to before you use something you got for free.

The Magix Movie Edit Pro 2016 was easy to jump in and get started using  but then I've had experience using similar video editing packages in the past. Someone new to video editing will probably be facing a pretty steep learning-curve trying to use this software for the first time. The company has provided a fairly detailed 400 page PDF user manual to read, but my suggestion is to go online and check out the video tutorials that are available on the companys website. These short videos are more a overview of someone demonstrating many of the software's features than actual tutorials  but you do learn something from viewing them. I first worked my way through the software by having one of the videos open on one of my screens and the software up on the other, and following along as the video played. This is probably a good place to mention something that sort of irked me about the tutorial videos. There are three different versions of this video editing software available (Pro, Pro Plus, and Pro Premium). The tutorials aren't very clear as to what features are in what package (well, they sort of do, I just didn't pick up on it). So after viewing the videos before I actually got the software, I was a bit disappointed that the Pro version didn't include some of the features that I was really wanting to try out (screen capture for instance). Still, go check out the videos if you're just starting to use this software for the first time, or are considering buying it.

The interface and actual operation of the software was similar enough to what I've used in the past that I was able to get started with no problems. Like I mentioned at the start of this review, I've got a number of video device (too many really). The issue with that is there are a couple different video file formats each of those produce. But the  Movie Edit Pro can handle all of those. I'm able to import and edit everything. Some of the features I like with this new editing package are  the title / subtitle feature. I make a lot of video sideshows for people using the photographs and I found that titling images is something that a lot of people appreciate. Having the ability to choose a location for the text and changing up the look of the font is really helpful. I also like that you can choose a stock menu when you burn a project to a DVD or  Bluray.

I also have Magix's Music Maker 2016 Live on my computer, and like that the music files made with it can be directly used for this video editing package. It's great to make a custom soundtrack for a slide show in Music Maker and then simply drop it into the audio track in Movie Edit.

I could probably go on and on about the things I like with this software, but that's enough. I have to say I really enjoyed checking this out and think it will be something I'm going to keep using for awhile. I'd recommend it to anyone needing to edit the videos that they too probably have piling up on their computers and devices.

Just in case it might be helpful - I'm running this software on a five year old computer  a HP HPE-190t desktop with an i7 processor and 12GB of ram running Windows 7 Pro. I've got two monitors, a 27 and a 24 which works well as I can set the main program up on the larger screen and use the smaller one for the video pre-view window.","I've been using this for years, and I've never had any issues with cell phone recording.

BTW!- WD (#1 Western Digital) & Seagate both have free downloads of  basic ATI (Backup/Restore only, which is all I like anyway!- Browse their websites!), but you MUST have ""one"" of their drives installed on your system (mix is OK, but I had Hitachi, and since ""upgraded"" to WD Black on my laptop!)!

 -Wait 4min & ""temp disable your AV!"", wait 4 more min (HD light has now stopped flashing?), and do your Backup/Restore! Right click ATI & Run as Admin (ANY ATI... procedure! Win 7/Vista, blocks system changes!)!
Wait 2min after every closing of ATI, for the first no-activity reboot (it's slow to release files!).
-For Backups- Wait 4min, and do a normal reboot. Go into Recovery, Right click on the new backup, and Validate/Reboot!

-For Recovery- Wait 4min & do a Reboot
Wait 4min & Shutdown (not many system changes are ""fully"" complete, until After a cold startup!?)!

Note!- ""After"" you have registered ""either"" Trial, be sure & go into Tools, and cut a New Emergency Boot CD (In case your HD crashes... Trial CD will not copy to a new HD!).

With McAfee All Access, you enter the supplied code, set up an account on their web site and can immediately get the freshest version available.
This is a nice change from the usual model of security software where you are supplied with a disc that's so far out of date that you have to go back and upgrade what you just installed. That makes the entire process much simpler and much less painful.

Once loaded, the software did a decent job staying out of the way, but I did notice significant CPU use while running the full scan. I've learned to schedule those so the system has time to chew through all of my files while I sleep rather than trying to compete with it while it's working.

So I gave Acronis a try.  I set it up using Windows XP and had no trouble installing the program, nor adjusting the settings to make my initial backup as well as scheduling regular incremental backups thereafter. I used the feature of the software that creates a secured partition on the backup drive that can't be accessed by the operating system.  This partition does appear to be secure because Windows Explorer doesn't see it, and it is immune to the format command, as well.

The backups ran as scheduled, no problem.  Then I upgraded to Vista, using a clean install, rather than backing up the old and restoring on the new because I wanted to clean out some stuff that I no longer wanted. Acronis installed just as easily on Vista, no problems.

Couple of things: One, Acronis has more flexibility with scheduling regular tasks than does Ghost, and has more features as well. Second, I have not actually had to use the restore function yet; I have only been backing up my discs but not restoring anything.

Registration was a waste of time. In order to get updates and other goodies you had to give permission to be contacted by PHONE, MAIL and EMAIL. Most software asks for a preferred contact style. This one opens the door to getting calls and junk mail from Nuance and its associates. At that point, since I value my privacy I unchecked the contact permission. Then I couldn't get the letter in the spam prevention box to take no matter how many times I refreshed them. I ended up aborting the process since there was no real point in registering unless I agreed to be contacted.",I got this for personal use. I use Word Processing software to help me manage my workload. I have a Word processor but can't use any other program. I tried it on my PC and it ran perfectly. It worked perfectly.

Having said that, it does freeze up and crash fairly frequently to the point where anything more than a casual YouTube video would be difficult to edit reliably. I'd like to see these problems patched since the user interface is good but it needs to be more stable. Feature-wise there are many special effects, transitions and sound tracks - more than enough for home or prosumer usage and certainly very generous at this price point. I'll keep playing with the software and waiting for software patches - if the stability improves, for the price it's a 4-5 star product.","I was really disappointed that Netscape discontinued its performance.

It took 10 minutes including the reboot and product activation.  It would have taken about a minute less if I didn't have to retype the monstrous product key three times.  If you are a user of version 4.0, the interface will feel very familiar.  One nice improvement is the performance tab.  You can mouse over icons on a particular date and see what was installed - software, windows updates etc. -what scans were done, what was downloaded and any threats detected.  There is also a safe web icon where you can enter and check out a URL before going there in your browser.

If you are upgrading, I have a word or warning.  After the upgrade your Norton will be all green checks indicating everything is in order.  This was not the case for me.  I ran Live-update just to make sure and it connected and downloaded over 100mb of data and required another reboot.  Another thing to do to improve performance after install is to run Norton Insight.  It increases performance by identifying files that do not need consistent scanning.

Of note, in the May 2011 edition of Maximum PC, Norton ranked 9 of 10 in their antivirus shootout.  It proved very effective in stopping viruses and malware.  It uses SONAR technology which watches program behavior to ID threats and not just virus definitions.  That is why I decided to continue using Norton.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the product.","Upgrading your antivirus to a better version (and still vulnerable to viruses) is now easier than ever before, especially when you're using it for yourself.

The only problem is that the bugs in this first release are so annoying and problematic that I've wasted more time trying to work out the kinks than being productive.  Going from the stability of Tiger to this has been a huge dissapointment.

My advice is to hold off a bit until they get some of these issues worked out.  Here are a list of the problems I am experiencing on both my Mac Pro and Macbook (other Mac owners are reporting similar problems on their machines):

1.  Desktop freezing - both machines frequently have their desktops freeze up, making them inaccessible.  The solution is to change the screen resolution to a lower setting and back.  **Since the 10.5.1 update I have not experienced additional desktop freezing issues**

2.  Installation woes - Leopard's upgrade disc did not recognize my Mac Pro's system drive initially, I had to run one of the programs on the installation disc in order to get it to pop up for the install.

3.  Font problems - If you do a lot of graphic design work and are continually receiving fonts along with a Quark or Adobe inDesign document, definitely hold off on upgrading.  A few current projects that opened up fine in Tiger simply don't recognize the fonts under Leopard.

4.  Back to My Mac - This for me was I upgraded.. Sadly it just doesn't work and likely won't for most of us. Checking through online discussion boards many other folks are equally frustrated in trying to get this thing to work.  Apple has recently posted a message indicating that expanded support for third party routers is ""coming soon.""  Huge oversight to be hyping a feature that will only work for those with a $180 Apple router.  Similar PC products like Hamachi work flawlessly, there's simply no excuse for this.  *** Since the 10.5.1 update Back to My Mac is working MUCH better, including a recent stay at a hotel. I'd say a bulk of the problems described above have been fixed.**

5.  Spaces - this great virtual desktop application is plagued by sucking applications into 'limbo' and occasionally cycles through the available desktops randomly when some apps display warnings.

6. Video glitches - The display on my Mac Pro (running an ATI x1900XT) often gets lines of gibberish streaking through the display.  Others are reporting similar issues.  **UPDATE:  Leopard taxes video hardware significantly more than prior releases of OS X.  X1900XT cards on the Mac Pro are experiencing an issue with dust building up on the heat sink which is blocking airflow and overheating the card.  Vacuuming out the heat sink has improved the problem for me.

7.  The new ""Dock"" is horrid..  The 3D ""glass"" effect makes it difficult to see which applications are currently loaded.  Thankfully a simple terminal command can remove the fancy effects and make it a bit more manageable.

8.  Time Machine works as advertised with an external drive attached to a USB or firewire port.  Getting it to work over a network with a Macbook is another story..  It will recognize internal drives on a networked machine, but external drives attached to that same networked computer are hit or miss.

Are any of these show stoppers?  With the exception of the font issue, probably not.  But if your system is running reliably with Tiger, I'd hold off a bit until Apple gets some of these issues worked out and releases their first round of updates.

Clearly the development team struggled getting this out the door, and it shows.  Definitely the most disappointing Apple product I've purchased in quite some time.","I've been using Tongue as a mainstay, and I was really disappointed that Tongue didn't give me any real issues when it comes to the stability of my PC.

It replaced the Bit Defender Total Security that was starting to bog down the system with slow updates. To me, the best internet protection suites are the ones that work silently in the background, doesn't cause conflicts with other programs, and updates quietly and efficiently as scheduled. The Kaspersky Pure (KP) achieved that and even threw in some extra protection. In addition to real-time protection against viruses, malwares, and spywares; small, frequent updates + Cloud based updates; Two-Way firewall, Anti-phishing, etc., KP also provides Control Center management of all PC's in the home network, remote management of parental controls, etc. Especially helpful to consumers are the Password Manager, scheduled, Automatic data backup, Encrypted data vaults, and File shredder that effectively wipes deleted files off one's system permanently (non-retrievable).

If setting up a company from scratch, the software behaved fairly well and the setup was fairly straightforward.  However, in doing a conversion the upgrade path was troublesome.  The user interface was well placed and organized, but wasn't advanced compared to other accounting software I have used.  There were many features that I would consider premium, unless of course, you are taking into account their service and support pricing road map.

It really appears that Sage is trying to get you to buy into more of their services.  You could be easily looking at additional investments for payroll services and future upgrades that offer little benefit.  For small startups, Sage 50 Premium could be an excellent buy, although I would be concerned about future support and services.  For businesses on other established systems or those are growing quickly, I would really weigh the options and look at a more versatile package.  In my prior work in accounting systems, you really want to look at how much customizations you might need.  Sage 50 Premium is actually pretty good if you go with all of the canned functions.

NBRT allows one to do the same things you used to need the DVD to do, but it's even more powerful. NBRT is versatile. You can install it on a DVD, or make an ISO, or make a bootable jump drive. When you run it, it updates the file to use the latest signatures for the scan if your PC is connected to the I-net (I don't remember the DVD doingt that).

With this product I had hoped to consolidate some of my disparate products that Corel had acquired over the past few years (PaintShop and ULead Video, mostly). Products that I have not upgraded because they still offer more than the replacement products currently offered by Corel. Subconsciously, I probably knew better. Software companies seldom bundle products without a reason, often because they are not selling enough of them separately and feel that they can get a little more mileage from a product by bundling it.

First - this is serious business software and not to be confused with run-of-the-mill GPS software. There's a reason why it is priced at about 10 times its stablemate, ""Streets and Trips"".

Second - I'm in total awe of this software ;)

With that out of the way, here's the rest of my review.

# Installation

I simply went with all the bells and whistles, and installed it on a budget notebook (Vista 64 bit, AMD Turion TL-60, 4GB RAM, 250GB HDD). The software installed fine, and runs like a dream. In over a month of using it, I haven't experienced any serious issues.

# User Interface

A lot has been said about the ""kludgy"" interface. And, yes, the toolbar icons are ugly. However, when you're driving at night, and your spouse is trying to click icons in a moving vehicle, I'm sure the wisdom of fat icons will be more readily apparent, and you'll praise the programmers who gave you nice juicy targets to click on.

The user interface is largely pane-based. Each pane is independently closable and resizable, but not dockable. I found this fairly pleasant, and it never cramped my style.

Navigation  around the map is fairly intuitive - click and drag to move the map; the mouse cursor on the edges turns into scroll arrows; and double clicking zooms in. Contextual menus on right clicking also give you the right level of control.

The one non intuitive aspect is that to create a region, you must actually right click and drag. Then to zoom in, you click inside that region. But it works.

# Function

The main purpose of this software is to support ""location based applications"". In other words, this software works by allowing you to project the non-location portions of your data onto a map. To make this happen you need to begin with data that has location (street, city, county, state) attributes as well as non-location attributes (such as sales figures, inventory numbers, and demographic data such as age and income).

You then tell MapPoint what location attribute to use in generating the map, and what non-location attributes you wish to represent, and sit back and prepare to be amazed.

When you consider that you can have this data sourced from a variety of data sources (natively from delimited text files, Access databases, Excel spreadsheets, and via Microsoft Data Link); and that you can program MapPoint applications using the .NET suite to access the MapPoint ActiveX control and its rich object model; and that you can integrate MapPoint with your PowerPoint presentations and Word documents, you have an amazing amount of power at your disposal.

What is positively astounding is the level of visualization you can achieve with this software.

You can pick the type of ""data map"" you want to create (push pins, pie charts, shaded areas, bar charts, etc.);  how  you want to represent ""data ranges"" on your maps (unique values, quantiles, continuous ranges, etc.); as well as customizing the colors, pushpins, etc. that make up your finished visualization.

Yes, it can do routing and GPS - but that's just icing on the cake.

# Why this rating?

What excites me most about this software is that its one of those rare products that take about a couple of hours to figure out, and then take a lifetime to master.

The possibilities are truly endless.

If you have a need for location based visualization - you owe it to yourself to download a trial version of this software, and run the tutorials. For the investment of a couple of hours, I can bet you'll come away as one of the converted.

Good luck!","I've used this for years and it's been running for 10 years. So for me, it's been a great way to find something without breaking my mind. I had no idea why the software stopped being so powerful."

The Business package is used for some family Trusts I manage and these Trusts hold actively managed investment accounts, each with over 80 securities transactions to report on Schedule D.  My biggest beef with the software is no support for importing data to Form 8949 in order to populate Schedule D on a Form 1041 Trust return.  So one has to either spend a month of Sundays manually keying in the data to TaxCut, or go pay a third party service where you can actually upload trading data you can download from your Financial institution to populate the Form 8949s and a Schedule D.  Then you get to manually reconcile the totals from the third-party provided Schedule D in TaxCut software so you can proceed to file it all on paper (I've filed paper Trust returns of 90+ pages with all this crap).  A very unsatisfying experience either way.

The online forums for this package are full of requests to address this problem and others, but nothing ever ever seems to be addressed or improved.  They clearly don't want to make their DIY products better.  They want to drive you to hire them to do your return.

I'm one of the fortunate ones who hasn't had insurmountable problems installing the software on my Windows 7 computer, but I wish this company would listen to their customers who, year-after-year-after year post requests to fix the same serious shortcomings with the product, yet never ever do it.  I can only conclude that they don't pay their engineers enough for them to invest their money in the markets, thus they don't know what investors need in a Tax software package.","I purchased this software because it's part of my business and I was part of it for six months.

I have spent hours on this program trying out the different functions and all but one (video) are very easy to figure out, the data/copy, music/audio, photo, and copy/convert.

On the Burn Data Disc function I like that you can easily remove single or multiple files from the burn window and also rename if desired.

I have gotten stuck on the very comprehensive video section.  I want to organize and string together my hundreds of video clips taken over the years and you can do many different things to enhance the final video.  I experimented with just three video clips totaling 5 minutes and burned it onto a re-writable DVD and it actually played on my PS3 without being closed/finalized.  Then I tried about 50 clips of different formats that would fill up the DVD and there was a problem with the encoding so I am now in the process of using the copy/convert function to make them all the same, MPEG-2, hoping it will solve the problem.

I'm not very experienced with these types of programs so it's understandable that I will have a more time consuming learning curve.  So far though I am very impressed; this software offers everything I have wanted to do with my pictures, music and video. I will update this review as I discover/learn/solve functions and issues.

Update:  I could not figure out the reason I could not burn a movie disc containing multiple movie clips I had put together and saved to a file and found that it will error out if you try to burn it from within the software.  If you close the software and access the file from wherever you saved it, it will burn the DVD with no problem.","I tried this program and found helpful if I needed to remove the annoying installation software package.

The graphics are still amazing and the features are new and improved! In this game, Nancy gets to have a PDA (personal digital assistant) that she takes around with her. It's a phone book and notebook. Nancy jotts down important notes and such in it and this time, you don't have to scroll ALL THE WAY DOWN to look at the new stuff she wrote (unlike the previous Nancy Drew game). It's really scary in the beginning and in other sections too. You have to snoop around at night and go to the graveyard! I'd say it is pretty freaky. But it's loads of fun.

Just stunned that there is ANY gold stars - let alone more than one.

Let's just say that I hold highly suspect anyone who writes a glowing review of this garbage-software.  They either are ""lite"" computer users or they are drinking the Microsoft cool-aid (or taking a mind altering drug).  I'm guessing that is was OneCare staff members looking for job security who filled out those posts speaking highly of this product.

The interface is horrible, simply bad, and you, as a user will have to spend added time ""learning"" it.  So if you're into spending those free hours of yours getting used to the way some incredibly poorly skilled user-interface designer at Microsoft has designed things - then great - everyone should have a hobby.

Yeah, when they say this is for 3 computers - it doesn't mean that if you buy two it is for 6 users (and so on)- like one might conclude.  Nope. Microsoft in a stellar moment of short-sightedness decided to cripple the software's ability to scale beyond 3 computers - no matter how many licenses you buy.  [actually you *can* use this on more than 3 machines; there are ""work-arounds"", but you will loose the ""uber-control""- which is really what this is suppose to do.

So if you happen to be one of those folks who has more than 3 computers, or ever in your life expect you'll have more than 3 computers... then this is not for you (or anyone really).  -Just STUPID Microsoft, just stupid.

Like being reminded of stupid things OneCare wants you to do... well good because this is a high-maintenance bit of software.  Frequently the software wants you to do things it's way - or it will not allow for the ""all clear signal."" Flexible it is NOT.

Norton/Symantec offer a competing product which is wwwwwwaaaaaayyyyyy better (and faster) than this (*&^%$#@!).  I had to figure this out the hard way.  I hope you don't.

If you think I'm joking/kidding/exaggerating...  check out how hard they make it to find the ""techical support phone number for OneCare"" - google it on the web and you'll find tons of angry users complaining about the very fact that you have to spend over 4 minutes and click 36 times through a series of help-dialog boxes (I tested this) before you can be provided a telephone number.  Yes, that's right, the user-interface is literally designed to prevent you from finding out what the tech-support number is(!) - so bad is it that when I had the Microsoft trained OneCare tech support staff member go through all the 36 clicks and so-on he got lost and couldn't find where to go to get the number (which would be to call himself more-or-less)...

Don't buy this product.  That's really the kindest thing I can say about it to you.  I have to manage 7 computers for a home-office and this software has cost me more in added time using and trying to use it than I care to admit.  Definitely not worth the money.

Good luck","I read that computer software can cause problems like those that I had gotten at the store. After using this product, I decided to look into it and saw how much time it was used. (The software that is used here is useless)."

The first is the GPS receiver.  I have previously used a Garman GPS 60cs for hiking and such, but even as it's great for tracking in the wilderness it doesn't have near the detail that newer, larger, more street driving, oriented GPS's have.  But, it has a good signal and is pretty rugged.  That's the comparison.  The USB GPS provided took a bit bit longer than my Garmin to find the location, but when it did it was pretty surprisingly accurate.  It was very easy to install on my XP laptop, and really worked well in tracking movement and location.  The first time I plugged it in I was in the living room of a 1st floor apartment.  The signal didn't seem to go through the walls very well, and it couldn't pick anything up. That's to be expected.  Outside that location, everything worked perfect.  Easily linked up with the Streets & Trips.

A lot of details have already been given about Streets and Trips itself. I have used Garmin's software--both their North America Streets version and their Western National Parks/Forests version.  I've also become quite a fan of google maps, with occasional use of the other versions.  The major benefit, of course, to Streets and Trips is that unlike Google or the others it doesn't depend on an internet connection.  The major benefit, of course, of another Garmin or other type of GPS is that even this version packaged with the GPS is significantly cheaper--if you have a laptop already.

The software is easy to use and intuitive.  I need to poke around more but I've been pretty satisfied so far. The list of interesting places is very good, as is the overall maps and associated tools. I've not used previous versions of Streets and Trips, so I can't compare this particular version to previous ones.

The one big issue I have with it, that has me using Google a lot in short, one-stop trips is that there doesn't seem to be a way of rerouting the directions.  With Google, a little cursor click and move can shift the route to something that might be preferred for whatever reason. Living in the LA area, as I do, there are a lot of ways to get from here to there, and a lot of reasons why what might seem on paper to be the best isn't at all the best.  The only other downside isn't to do with the software, but instead having to bring my laptop with me places.  Meaning this really is something that I'd use a lot for longer trips, but not as much for the shorter ones.

I'm quite pleased, especially given the price.","I was using this because I was a fan of the GPS receiver and I was able to find it in the car. I was hiking on the track and saw some good hiking videos on it. However, I couldn't pass it"

The emphasis was not on speaking, but rather to give us the basic tools in order to begin the process of deciphering German texts.  I've had a few other language classes since then, establishing me if not as a thorough polyglot at least as a someone well versed in language training from a variety of different teaching styles, approaches, and contexts.

I've tried to keep up with a number of these languages I've studied, with various success, and with various software help. Mostly the inexpensive kind.  I've picked up the Instant Immersion disks (a great, inexpensive, entirely un-thorough approach), the Learn to Speak series (about the same, though with a lot more content).

Recently, to learn German for my studies I looked at more thorough programs and two stood out.  The Rosetta Stone series and the Tell Me More.  I noticed Tell Me More was getting great reviews and was less than half the price.  Being a little financially strapped I skipped the trend and bought Tell Me More. And I'm very glad I did. It's an effective program that has pushed me quite along in learning the language.

Still, there was a tickle in my brain.  Is Rosetta Stone really better?

Now, with Rosetta Stone German and Tell Me More German in hand I have an answer.

And yes, Rosetta Stone is the better program.

In some ways.

Really, I'd have to say these are quite different programs, rather than one being substantially better.

Tell Me More is a like a class in a box.  There is a mix of exercises that help to build vocabulary, sentence structure, writing, pronunciation, and other aspects.  Each section has a large mix of short lessons that reinforce the learning without becoming dull or tedious.  Save yourself taking language classes by using Tell Me More.

Rosetta Stone is a lot less like taking a class.  It's more like finding yourself on an island with a group of people who all only speak another shared language.  And if you want to learn how to thrive on this island, then you follow their patient, but focused, teaching.  The lessons advance by building on previous lessons, adding grammar and vocabulary in small increments without being separate focus.  Rosetta Stone goes for whole learning, approaching the language as a whole rather than in separate topics.  Also, there is a tracking system so that after a certain amount of days a review lesson pops up that makes sure what was learned a couple of weeks ago is still there.  Good confidence boost too.

This approach sticks, and it is effective.

My only quibble is I'm not sure it's quite worth the amount of money they are asking.  Indeed, if money isn't an issue then by all means go with Rosetta Stone.  There are qualities that do set it apart, and it helps a person feel much more involved in the language and less like taking a class. I see it also as a continued resource way beyond the initial run through, providing a consistent platform to keep the language sharp.

The island analogy is also appropriate because Rosetta Stone doesn't have nearly the same amount of cultural exposure that Tell Me More does.  The Tell Me More program offers more German (as in the country) exposure, along with Austria and Switzerland.

Tell Me More also has a more potent vocabulary push, especially early on.  Rosetta Stone takes a long while to build a foundation and with this can become pretty repetitive.

But, if money is an issue Tell Me More is comparable in quality, without being nearly as expensive.

That's not a slam against the product quality of Rosetta Stone at all. It really is an extraordinary software, and revolutionizes language learning.",I was really disappointed that Avon discontinued this program because I didn't have time to read the books (I mostly used English) and found that the emphasis on reading the books was on the written word.

The best you'll get away with is repurchasing Quicken every 3 years if you want to retain the online banking feature. I presently run the 2010 version which works well. I see no reason to upgrade and agree with some other reviewers that Quicken upgrades rarely improve anything or add useful features. However, I now get frequent reminders that if I don't upgrade by April I'll lose the online banking feature. That is blackmail! If I ever find a decent useful personal finance program that supports online banking, I'll switch in a second without looking back. Mint looks decent but it is now owned by Intuit and will soon become Quicken. I used Microsoft Money a long time ago and would still use it if it had not been discontinued.

It deserves only a 1-star rating, but I give it 2 stars because I've had a good experience with Quicken 2010 so far.

11/27/2013 update: I compromised my morals and upgraded to 2013 because nothing else looked very robust. Lowered to one star because the 2013 version is not any different than the 2010 version, yet I was forced to upgrade to retain online banking. Idiots. I'd really like to monitor anticipated income and expenses easily. I can probably do it with Quicken but it is soooo cumbersome and takes way too much time and thought to make it work. Microsoft Money did it well but that was many years ago. We've come a long ways backwards with Quicken. Quicken 2013 also doesn't like the Quicken Exchange Format that one of my banks uses so online banking is only partially successful.

2/8/2014 update: Yet another reason to hope that Quicken or someone else comes out with a better product. I anticipate a budget crunch in 2014 to pay for unforseen federal taxes so I started a budget under Planning. They've removed a feature that previously existed! I'd like to specify the starting month for my budget but I'm limited to complete Jan-Dec years. I don't consider defining a date range for a budget to be an advanced feature. Another thing I'd like to be able to do is enter paychecks in as bi-weekly, not monthly. That is not possible with Quicken 2013 Home and Business.

Intuit is slowly dumbing down Quicken to the point were anyone can use it at a very basic level at the cost of leaving experienced users in the dustbin. The problem with doing that is once people own it and try to use it for the purpose it was designed for, they become experienced users and start looking around for something better.

As long as an account is setup before trying to downloading the product, it downloaded and installed easily for me. Yes, it took time. After all, this is a bloated Microsoft product. This version of Office is sort of a hybrid, or so it feels - partly in the cloud, but mostly on your computer. That it good for people on the go and need to access documents that may have been saved at different locations on different machines or devices. Documents can be saved to the Skydrive associated with your account. In order to use this program, unlike a standard office version, you must be logged into the account you created, or a previous account that can be linked to the subscription. The subscription includes free apps (must be downloaded from the app stores) for iPhone and I would imagine Android and Windows mobile as well, which allow viewing and editing documents as well as accessing the Skydrive from a mobile device (Don't tell the boss about this).

The new look of Office 365 is more in line with Windows 8, but it is flat, colorless and dull. Microsoft does not give you many options to change it either. There are three different themes to choose from - White, Light Gray and Dark Gray. Wow! Microsoft really? I would at least have expected a light blue like Office 2007 offered. At least if White or Light Gray is chosen there is a thin line of color at the bottom status bar, with dark gray chosen this is black. The color changes based on the program being used - blue for Word, green for Excel, etc. There is also a background pattern that can be chosen which is really just in the top right hand corner of the screen. These uninteresting patterns are grey, but vary in shade based on the ""theme"" chosen. Pretty unexciting.

As far as functionality goes, Office hasn't changed that much in the last few versions, there is a customizable ribbon at the top which changes based on the tab that is chosen. Microsoft has done away with any sort of shading or shadowing to make the ribbon stand out in any way, it is incredibly flat looking, which is kind of disconcerting, and at times confusing. Clicking on ""File"" (which for some reason always has a colored box around it) slides open another screen where there are other options. This is where more of a Windows 8 look comes into play (and a little bit more color). The options are pretty much the same as in other Windows versions, just presented differently. Save As offers an option to save to the computer as well as to the Skydrive. Microsoft installs a program that loads when the computer is started that keeps the Skydrive in sync with all the documents saved there. The icon in the computer's toolbar is a cloud with a green line moving from left to right. Because it is constantly synching, there is a noticeable, but not intolerable lag when typing, as compared to a non-cloud based system.

Office 365 comes with a license for up to 5 PC's or Macs which makes the $99.00 a year (at time the of review) price a good deal if utilizing all of them, since it offers the full Office suite, 20 GB storage on the Skydrive and 60 minutes of Skype per month all included in the subscription. It does not turn out to be such a good deal if it is only being used on one PC or Mac, in which case it might be better to get a non-subscription version which costs more upfront, but can be used until its obsolescence at no charge. The other versions offer the same features without the Skype credits and less storage space on the Skydrive. Windows 7 or 8 is required to run any new version of Microsoft Office product.

Microsoft Office is pretty much the world standard for software of this type. Other software has come and gone, so it is almost essential to own some version of Office these days. While Office 365 is not my favorite version that Microsoft has created, it's not that bad either. The lack of color makes their product boring and hard to navigate, and because there is no option to change this is frustrating.

pc | virus | program | cost | price | software | computer | run | system | drive | track | try | problem | load | backup | line | disc | space | product | praise | week | version | case | take | approach | lot | need | desire | experience,"Several years ago (2002) I grew tired of Norton programs and discovered that my Windows PC actually ran better without Norton Systems Works than it did with it, so long as I used a virus program. Works seemed to find non existent problems and used lots of resources. Since Norton Anti-Virus cost just about the same price as Systems works did I opted for one of the free anti-virus programs (Avast) and was very happy. I also have a Mac and use no Norton software on it.

Recently I obtained a new HP Vista computer and was happily running Avast on it with no problems. But I missed several programs I had on my XP system that did things like defrag my hard drive, keep track of my passwords, etc. So when this program became available in the Amazon Vine program and I noticed it had those separate programs that I had by other companies now incorporated all into one program called Norton 360 I decided to give it a try.

I had no problem loading the software and it seemed to configure effortlessly upon it's first start up. I've used all of the features on it thus far except the backup program. I am unclear as if the backup only works to the skimpy on-line disc space that comes with the product (more can be rented for what seems a fairly astronomical price). The features of the program seem to work well so far in all the areas I have tried.

I've read many of the other reviews for this program and it seems I may be praising it too soon since I've only had it installed about 3 weeks so far (on a 6 week old PC) and it seems that things begin to go sour shortly after that - we'll see. I would agree that it seems to work best with new computers with fresh Vista installations (Ultimate version in my case on a 6 week old PC). It seems to incur all sorts of problems on older systems with Vista upgrades.

So I'm taking a cautious approach and think that it's an average program that tries to do a lot, and if you have  the need or desire for these features and a fairly new computer it will probably work well for you. I can't speak for what your experience with older computers would be like.",I have a virus which makes me feel bad when using this program. I got this because it was so expensive.

remove | edition | lower | price | addition | quality | scrutiny | difference | interface | value | upgrade | version,"One of the biggest sins Microsoft committed with her Office XP Application Suite is removing the Publisher from its Professional edition without lowering the price.

It is fast, very easy to customize, and yields high quality Desktop Publishing outputs. Still, a close scrutiny revealed that its 'improvements' over the 2000 edition is only marginal.

More importantly, it heavily modified the user interface, changing the old way of menus to the new ""Ribbon Control"" with tabs and context-sensitive icons.

This is the Home & Student version of Office:  it contains Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.  The Home & Business Edition adds Outlook and the Professional Edition adds Access and Publisher.

Dude, Where's my Stuff?
While Office 2010 isn't as radical a departure as 2007 was, it is definitely different.  Users who have just gotten used to the Ribbon Control may be exasperated to find that once again features have been moved.  Gone is the circular ""Office"" button that used to be your access point for things like saving and printing--the ""File"" menu is back...but not quite.  The User Interface has been tweaked to provide more visible work surface, and yet there are now tabs in the ribbon that completely hide the work surface.  For example, the ""File"" menu will open a web-page-style layout that covers the entire window:  it offers basic menu items on the left, some large-button categorical options in the middle, and then refreshes the huge space on the right with large buttons for the basic features.  Instead of menus and sub-menus it is now more like navigating a web site.
Then there's the verbiage.  For example, ""Send...as e-mail attachment"" is now performed by choosing ""Save & Send"" on the left, then ""Send Using E-mail"" in the middle, and ""Send as Attachment"" on the right.
After a little bit of time looking at the Office 2010 Ribbon and Menus, you'll start to understand exactly what's been done to Office this time around.  Microsoft have added a huge ton of features, and then tried to put all of those as close to the navigation surface as possible.  In other words, you'll no longer be clicking *deep* into the menus, you'll be making one or two clicks and then looking at all the options that are dumped on your screen to pick which one you'll be using.  To make matters more confusing, some options (such as ""Save"" or ""Open"") drop you off the File Menu, give you the typical Open/Save dialog box you are used to, and then automatically select the ""Insert"" tab and show you the work surface before you finish making your selection.  It can get very distracting.

Return of the Feature Creep
In the past whenever Office bolted on new items (such as blogging), the typical way of dealing with it was to give you toolbars that you could show, hide, and drag around to arrange at the top of your screen.  Now what we have is:
- Tab names at the top that come and go based on what you're doing (like Office 2007)
- Changes to the workspace based on which tab you've selected
- A File Menu that is no longer a candy-like button but is another tab on the ribbon...and yet it drops every possible option onto the screen and trusts you to navigate through them.

Tuned and Tweaked
That said, Microsoft have done something under the covers that has been a blessing and a curse.  On the one hand, your programs will load lightning-quick.  On the other, if you try to keep two installations of Office on the same machine, what is supposed to work will instead work unevenly:  Word and Excel will let you open both versions, but my installations of Outlook and Project completely blocked my ability to launch the 2007 versions (despite repeatedly indicating otherwise during installation and configuration).

Future Forecast:  Bright, but Cloudy
The other feature Office 2010 places more at the forefront is the idea of The Cloud.  In Office-Speak, this means using the Internet to keep documents synced in real-time no matter where you go.  If you remember Windows Briefcase, this is everything the Briefcase should have been.  If you ever tried the File Sync Wizard, Windows Sharing and Synchronization, or ActiveSync, this is like an invisible, hands-free version of that.  There's good and bad about this and you want to be aware of what it entails before you get involved.  For example, you can create a new file and choose ""Store on Web"" or ""Save to Web"".  When you do this, you will be prompted to choose the location.  If that location is a Windows Live account, then you'll want to pay attention to whether you are saving to a private folder or a public one.  From that point forward, any time you open the document on any machine it can fetch the latest version from the web.  If you don't want your document to sync automatically it can also be done manually.

If you're used to Microsoft Office 2007, you will be impressed with Office 2010's addition of features and its performance as a program.  Expect to be frustrated from time to time when something appears to have `moved'.  If you're new to the revised Office system of 2007 and 2010, it is a complete look-and-feel overhaul and you will want to spend some time getting to know it.","I have been using this for years and have been using it since, very little change.

Facing increasing pressure to get ""something"" out the door, and having gone through several failed attempts to unleash a modern operating system to replace the aging, original Macintosh operating system, Apple threw OS X (10.0) at dedicated Mac users as, essentially, a pay-to-play beta test.  Why, you might ask, would Mac users pay to play with a not-yet-ready for primetime OS?  I suppose you should ask Windows users the same question.  At lease Apple was kind enough to tell people that 10.0 was not for everyone and was going to be revised substantially.
Then came 10.1 (now at version 10.1.5).  It improved the speed and features of 10.0 and made it ready for universal adoption.
OS X 10.2 completes the cycle.  OS X has now been optimized.  It's fast, elegant, and groundbreaking.  It has been radically improved to work seamlessly with Windows computers and Windows networks.  It has built in, easy to use Bluetooth support.  Over all, it has about 150 additions and improvements.

So I was glad to try this product out. Of course, you have to deal with your own laptop issues in a vehicle when you want to use this - so it's a little more burdensome than a TomTom. But I found it quite useful.

The software installation was nice and simple for me - I have XP. But at home, my GPS was not picking up many satellites. It did eventually find some, but it took a while. And every time I start up the software, it seems to take a few minutes to find the satellites from inside my home. That part was not good because I wanted to make sure I knew how to use the product before going out on the road! But eventually, it would track enough satellites to give me good directions, etc. The audio was loud enough on my laptop, but I think it could stand to be louder. You never know when you're going to drive through a very noisy intersection, etc. And then there are plenty of tools in this software. Calculate the cost of a trip (you can input gas price, etc.), find good restaurant deals on a certain route, etc. I haven't used all the tools much, but I'm sure these are great for the frequent travelers.

version | search | box | feature | look | assistance | program | software | work | project | fan | computer | upgrade | have,"I'm happy to upgrade to the newest version of Microsoft programs. I use Word the most. The updates from Word 2013 to this version isn't as drastic as some upgrades, but it still has some handy new additions. The search box to ""Tell me what you want to do"" is nice. I often have to Google to figure out where a feature I'm looking for is located. It's nice to have assistance within the program. This features is also in the other included software.

It's nice to be able to have the collaborate feature if multiple authors are working on a project. The software has Smart Lookup, but it's powered by Bing, which I am not a fan of, so I won't likely use that feature too often.

This downloaded and installed easily. The nice feature about this over Office 365 is that once you install it, it doesn't expire. I use Office 365 on another computer and it must be renewed annually.

While usually I prefer paying once for software, it's hard to look at the pricing and not see the value in considering the cloud version. You not only get 1 TB of cloud storage, you get the full suite of products, at a price that gives you two years of access for less than the standalone software costs. Of course, Mac users still don't get ALL the software that PC users get, and until they do, I will not give ANY Office version more than 4 stars at best. While I wouldn't tend to use Access as much these days, Publisher is software that absolutely should be included in the Mac version when PC users get it. However, this review is for Home and Student which only includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote. Note that Outlook is not included, something to be aware of if you are looking at purchasing this version, over the 365 Personal license which DOES include it. Of these, OneNote is the application I haven't used a whole lot, simply because I have so much in Evernote and haven't really had a need to look at migrating to OneNote. You can get OneNote as a standalone on the Mac Store for free, so it's worth looking at if you don't already use Evernote, but if you do want to use it, you almost certainly would want the 365 version so you have cloud storage for easy sharing of your notes across your desktop and mobile devices. Likewise a lot of the newer features in the other applications require cloud storage, such as sharing features. While you don't have to have a 365 license to use these, the only cloud services available are MS's OneDrive cloud service and Sharepoint. It's very annoying that they don't offer such popular cloud services like Dropbox but clearly they want to push users to get the 365 licenses instead which include the full 1TB of storage. If you don't need to keep a lot of docs on OneDrive though, the free account may work fine for you.

Now if you are a current Office for Mac user, the question is whether there are suitable updates here to look at upgrading. If you are more than 1 or two versions behind, it's pretty much a given that you would want to update, the new ribbon (toolbar) is much more elegant and user friendly, proper keyboard shortcuts are available, the various Mac touch gestures are supported, etc. And there's tons of improvements in the  applications themselves. I particularly loved the new theme designer feature in Powerpoint which gives you not only many more slide designs, but makes it really easy to switch them to different color schemes. Slide transitions are now better supported across PC and Mac versions and there is an improved presenter view, and dedicated animations panel. The formula designer in Excel has been updated, and there is better support for the full range of functions that the PC version had. More chart designs are now available, and comments in Word can now be fully threaded conversations. Print to PDF is better in all the apps, as well. Overall, the features definitely are worth a look, but the lack of Outlook and high cost for just the 3 main programs (OneNote being free to download anyway) does make it a bit hard to recommend this version over a 365 license. If you don't need Outlook, don't have a need to upgrade your apps very often, don't plan to use cloud sharing much, and mainly just want copies of the applications for cross-platform support with PC users that send you files, this might be worth considering versus the 365 version, but you'll need to use it for more than 2 years before you see any savings. So I rather the upgrade as a solid 4 stars, but I'd give this specific version only 3 stars for the value that you are getting for the price.",I've used this for over 30 years and found helpful retaliates by paying full price for the software.

There's several small things that as I sit here to write this I probably can't remember.  It's just when you're doing your taxes, you go ""That's cool"", and move on. :)  I do love the ability to check against my own stupidity in entering things incorrectly.  This software is great at what it does.  Properly file my taxes.  Usually finds me a few bucks better in deductions and all that, too.  Honestly, it's tax software.  Hard to write a lot about it.  We all know about filing taxes, this software does that well.

However, about the pricing which most people seem to be talking about..

I don't have a problem with this move. Mostly because I only file one return, and I e-File. For me, this move saves me $5. The program has traditionally cost me about $20 (I buy basic), and then I efile, so my cost in the last few years was $35. Amazon is currently selling this for $30, so I'll save $5.

If I was someone who did multiple efiles then I might feel differently, but for me, this is a positive. I'm not naive, I can see where people might have issues with this due to situation. That I don't have a problem with.

However, a lot of the complaints I'm reading here are from people who seem to like to complain.  God help you if you have a positive opinion about something, you get branded stupid, your opinion is invalid. It seems that the only way you can be accepted anymore on the Internet is to have a negative opinion. Sigh.

This text reads ""FREE: 5 federal e-files and unlimited printed returns included with every TurboTax 2008 product.""

When I installed the software this evening it immediately downloaded an 82 megabyte upgrade, so I suspect some of the bugs mentioned in the other reviews have been addressed. I was able to upgrade my file from the 2011 version of the software without incident. I was also able to successfully edit a few transactions and conduct my end of week review without any problem.

There are some interface tweaks from the prior version, including a much improved invoice browser that actually makes sense. Speed is improved and the interface is starting to feel more like a native Mac app and less of a ported Windows implementation. Still if you're satisfied with the version you're using, there's nothing compelling here that makes this a must-have upgrade over a prior version - Unless you upgrade your Mac to Lion or Mountain Lion, as anything earlier than 2011 simply won't run.

What's missing?  An easy means of transaction importing is topping my list.  I run a small media network that shares advertising revenue with several dozen websites. All of that data is calculating in a spreadsheet, yet month after month I have to key in every transaction manually because Quickbooks simply lacks a sane method of importing those transactions. If they ever get around to making a transaction import scheme that works without having to produce precision crafted flat files I'm all in for a $200 upgrade.

Bottom line: if you're using Quickbooks 2011 or 2012 or are happy with the version you have there is no need to upgrade.

I've never been disappointed before - from Dos to Windows 95, from Windows 95 to XP, from XP to Vista, there has always been lots of new, fancy stuff for me to explore and enjoy.

Not Windows 7. It is almost identical to Vista in every way. And then there is the downside: some of the programs don't work. I read in other reviews that 7 is very backwards compatible. Well, the first thing I used, a little Vista sidebar gadget called Network Meter, doesn't work at all. Very annoying. But more importantly, the intel graphics driver doesn't work, so my screen remained blurry! And Intel doesn't offer updates for my chip, they said. Luckily I was able to find the driver for Vista, and it worked in 7, so I'm okay. But this bit about 7 being backwards compatible is just a joke to me. Better watch out that nothing I have is going to work on it.

Like Vista, 7's sound recorder is stripped down to bare minimum functions. I love using the sound recorder in XP; it's small, efficient, and has neat functions.

What's new about Windows 7? Well, it has a math input tool. As a mathematician, I find that thing STUPID. I draw a 2 in there, and it thinks it is alpha. If I draw +, it takes it to be psi. Be faster to get it out of the character map.

Other than that, there is nothing interesting. It advertises being able to record TV shows. Big deal; XP and Vista can do it too; just buy the tv tuner!  (For Windows 7 also.) I recently bought one here at Amazon. Not too expensive, and works great:

One thing I find irritating about 7 (and Vista) is its requirement for program signature verification. If it doesn't recognize a program you want to install, it flashes you a warning. I guess Microsoft wants everybody to register with them like they are the Gestapo. There is just one problem: I have used Vista for 2 years, have installed hundreds of programs big or small, and have NEVER encountered a program that owns the signature verification. This includes programs I download from Microsoft! So the warning is ubiquitous and meaningless like a grandma's caution against life's countless dangers. Why don't they give it up already? Nobody will ever sign up with them!

Another thing is, they won't let me put a file icon on the taskbar in 7. Worked fine in the other versions.

Another praise for Windows 7 is that it is stable and secure. I don't know why people talk about such matters; my XP and Vista computers are all plenty stable and secure. And just now, Windows 7 froze on the PBS online game my son is playing. So it's not like Windows 7 freezes less often.

I don't recommend Windows 7 if you already have Vista and is looking for something exciting in the new OS. They are the same. They even look the same. Otherwise; get either 7 or Vista; no need to get both, and you won't be disappointed.

I am getting rid of Windows 7 and putting XP back. I wonder if Microsoft will ever coming up with a new fancy OS again, or is this the best Windows is going to get? I am starting to think that those people at Microsoft have waxed fat.","I've been using this for the past 20+ years and I was really hoping it will be something that actually works.

title | review | reason | upgrade | sense | functionality | edition | contrast | try | install | version | experience | brand | advisor | backup | summary | run | system | having | operating | thing | pc,"As I noted in the title for this review I am unable to think of a reason why someone would ""upgrade"" from WinXP to Vista Home Premium.  I'm not sure I'd even call it an upgrade in the sense that there is no truly new and useful functionality in this edition.  This is in stark contrast to Vista Ultimate which DOES have many new features that make it a worthwhile upgrade.

However, this review isn't about Vista Ultimate--it is about Home Premium.  I would like to warn people that trying to do an upgrade install from XP to any version of Vista is, in my experience, almost guaranteed to fail.  I have even tried doing a brand new clean install of XP and then run the Vista advisor and finally install Vista as an upgrade.  I have not been able to get it to work.  So if you buy this I think it is wise to plan to do a ""clean"" install (this means you lose all your programs and settings so you'd need a thorough backup of your data).

In summary, I'm hard pressed to come up with a reason why someone running a stable WinXP system would want Vista Home Premium.  Having said that I do think it is a competent operating system and IF it is on a Vista Certified system then I think it is fine.  Nothing in my experience with Vista would cause me to want to ""downgrade"" from a stable Vista install to XP.

PLEASE NOTE: The most important thing I may be able to say here is that Remote Desktop is crippled in this version of Vista.  You can remote OUT to other computers but you cannot remote IN to a PC running Vista Home Premium.  To get Remote Desktop that is fully functional you have to get the Business or Ultimate edition.","I am so disappointed that AstraZene discontinued this blog and I'm reviewing it now.

The previous program has to be completely un-installed before a new program can be installed. Even though my last software was  from Trend I still encourtered this install problem with Internet Security Pro. So I knocked off one star for the annoyance of installation. The second star gets knocked off this review because my load time and memory use increased. Other then that the features and usability of Internet Security Pro are worthwhile and the cost of purchase. My only regret is that licenses are only for a year.,I had a hard time installing this program and found it to work just as well as any other program I had installed. I was really disappointed that the installer didn't install any of the required programs. The problem is that the program crashes

QuickBooks has the small business accounting software market almost to itself, although mostly on Windows.  Apple's market share in computing significantly increased during my hiatus and there has been a shift towards the internet, mobile devices and, more recently, the cloud.  Whether QuickBooks will fully embrace these changes has yet to be seen.  Intuit provides more services to small businesses than it used to and it is even teaming up with Bank of America to integrate software and financial services, although whether that will benefit small business owners, it is also too soon to know.

The basic software seems to be the same with tweaks and incremental improvements rather than a complete rebuild from the ground up.  It still doesn't do everything for everyone but it will allow the majority of small businesses owners to take care of most of the day-to-day bookkeeping and allow an accountant to use the files to submit a tax return, and at a very reasonable cost compared to what this would have cost just a few decades ago.

Some of the newer features are being able to have multiple users with access restricted only to certain functions such as payroll, tracking project time and expenses and billing them to clients, and exporting report data to Microsoft Excel.  Incredibly, batched importing of online banking transactions is new for 2012.  The overall look and feel has also been improved for Mac users.

Still, the Mac version does not have all the capabilities and features of the Windows version and it doesn't seem that this will change.  Apple computers can now run Windows and Windows-compatible software and the two operating systems have also become more similar.  So for most small business owners with Apple computers, the real question is not whether to use QuickBooks but whether to use the Windows or Mac version.  Ironically, at a time when Apple operating systems are gaining market share, starting out on or switching over to QuickBooks for Windows is now a much better option for Mac users than it ever has been.","I have been importing accounting software to help my company grow its revenues and profits.

The zip engine in WinZip 18 is said to compress files smaller and faster.  The Pro version includes a Backup function and the Jobs Wizard to automate repetitive processes.

Pros:
1) WinZip states it supports 25+ compressed file formats including Zip, ZipX, RAR, 7Z, ISO, IMG, BZ2, BZ, TBZ, TBZ2, TAR, Z, GZ, TGZ, LZH, CAB, UUencode, BitHex, and MIME.
2) WinZip now has iOS and Android apps for your tablets and smartphones.
3) You can connect to several cloud drives: Box, CloudMe, DropBox, GoogleDrive, SkyDrive, and SugarSync
4) WinZip can convert DOC, DOCX, Excel XLS, XLSX, PPT, and PPTX files to PDF (Adobe's Public Document Format).
5) You can share files on Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter.
6) The proprietary ZipX format saved JPG photos in a considerably smaller file.  A test of 100 photos of 450 MB was reduced only 1% (4 MB) in a traditional zip format, but were reduced 20% (90 MB) in a ZipX file.  (This was without the photo reduction feature that reduces picture dimensions.)
7)  WinZip states that there is an option to resize pictures to reduce file sizes (but this is apparently only found in the zip and email function).

Cons:
1) The License states that WinZip can be installed on up to 3 computers.  However after I installed it to my desktop computer, I installed it to my laptop.  When I entered the registration code I received an error that the activation code had already been used and it wanted me to buy another license.
2) While WinZip states that it supports 25+ compressed file formats, the Knowledgebase states it will only create Zip, Zipx, Lha/Lzh, and UUencoded files.
3) It can be really hard to find options in WinZip.  I spent nearly 10 minutes trying to find out how to save files into the ZipX format rather than the Zip format.  I wasn't able to find how to save an Lha file, even in the Knowledgebase.
4) WinZip claims that you can email an attachment of up to 2 GB in size.  However if you want to send attachments that large, you'll have to pay $10 a month for ZipSend Pro.  (Or you can use WinZip to upload the file to the cloud and send a link from the cloud.)
5) The WinZip Help states, ""WinZip can convert high-resolution images to more convenient sharing sizes instantly when adding them to your Zip file. Simply click Resize Photos in the Create or Edit tab and decide what size you want...""  When I click on Resize Photos, it doesn't do anything. And then when I add photos to the zip file, they are not reduced in size.
6) WinZip defaulted to the ""ribbon"" menus.  WinZip claims that its smart ribbon only shows you the tools you need but it sometimes hides the tools that you're looking for.  For example if you open a zip file and want to copy it to the cloud, that option is not shown on the default smart ribbon tab.
7) Some features are apparently available only from the right click menu within Windows Explorer and not from the smart ribbon menu.
8) Be advised that if you use the Move command to add a file to WinZip, the original file is moved to the WinZip file and then Winzip deletes the original file to the Recycle Bin.  So this could be a security issue if you believe that the file only exists in the WinZip file.
9) I created an encrypted zip file.  When I double clicked on the zip file to open it, WinZip opens the zip file and displays all of the files within the zip file and displays a password entry box.  I don't like it that WinZip displays the contents of the encrypted zip file prior to a password being entered. WinZip will also display some of the file properties without a password.  That might be helpful to someone trying to crack the encrypted zip file.
10) A couple hours after I installed WinZip 18 I found that I was unable to drag and drop files in Windows Explorer.  I had not uninstalled any other software in several days and this was the first time ever that I could not drag and drop in Windows 7 Pro.  So I attributed the problem to the new install of WinZip 18. After rebooting it seemed everything was back to normal, for now.
11) My copy of WinZip 17 had started giving me this error messages for unencrypted WinZip files that I had created:  ""Open WinZip File: You don't have permission to open this file. Contact the file owner or an administrator to obtain permission.""  Well I am the owner and the administrator.  I haven't seen this problem in WinZip 18 yet, but then I've only used it a few weeks.

There are a number of freeware zip programs available (like 7-Zip), so you would have to decide if the paid features in WinZip 18 are worth it.",I have a number of programs running Windows 7 and Vista with the latest version of Windows.

Well, I needed something to track my investments.  I needed to know, if overall I was making a decent return.  I don't want it for banking, etc.  I tried Acemoney and Moneydance.  Both of those were unable to download a ""starting"" balance from my brokerage accounts.  So, I reluctantly went back to Quicken.

By default, Quicken sends your data to it's website.  Turned that off!

I have brokerage accounts with Fidelity and ETrade.  So, far it works ok with Fidelity.  I have my accounts set up for dividend reinvestments.  ETrade goes out to 6 decimal places.  Quicken goes out to 6 decimal places for balances, but only 3 for transactions.  What?!  So, every dividend re-investment ends up out of balance and it makes you put in a place holder transaction for those fractions.  Updating the original and deleting the placeholder is a big pain.

First, it saves major time in transferring data from prior years' TurboTax-prepared tax returns (as far as I can tell) with impeccable precision.

But for the first time, TurboTax fails to transfer and translate many foreign currency transactions, just plugging the foreign currency as US Dollars. This was not the case in any of the past 10 years - or at least I hope not, or the IRS is going to send me to jail for life for tax fraud or some other pretext.

Also for the first time, Turbotax 2012 will not transfer data from a two-year old Quicken (2010) program, the license of which is valid for 2012, forcing the user either to upgrade to Quicken 2013, an horrifically sub-standard and under-tested piece of software, or manually transfer the data one account at a time.

I did a family member's US Domestic tax return with absolute precision and ease, transferring Quicken 2011 data with ease, so if you have no foreign entanglements you should find this program a joy to own and use, and I highly recommend TurboTax.

But should you have a Sheckel or a Pound, an Euro or a Baht, an Yuan or a Ruble in your accounts, you will have to carefully ensure you don't transgress the US Tax Monster, taking every precaution  - because the Intuit developers have not.

A bloody shame.

Almost every time TurboTax is opened, it asks if you want to check for updates.

Updating today, TurboTax Premier is replaced by TurboTax Basic, and the message is ""your configuration has changed, please re-install"" - so, obediently, I try. No Go. Have to re-download from Amazon. Okay, there went another fifteen minutes down the drain. Then: ""There is another version of TurboTax 2012. Please uninstall."" More minutes. Finally, after more than three quarters of an hour wasted, the new program is installed, all the ""check here"" boxes checked, and it too only 46 minutes - oops, had to check for updates again, one more update, then at last TurboTax opens!

Now 20 years later, give or take, they are still around and kicking.  Toast still offers the same easy-to-use interface for burning and creating dvd content.  It also now offers some other related functionality.  You can record screen activity, and you can also convert video to different formats.  I was disappointed by the video converter, as it would not recognize an avi file that I tried to convert (and the iskysoft video converter handles this file fine).  There's also another interesting utility included, that helps you catalog the contents of disks or directory structures.

The bottom line for me is that Toast is still a great tool if you need to burn disks, and it will even do blu-ray disks now.  The other utilities have some usefulness, but there are usually better ways to do what they do, or better tools to use.","I have been using this product for years and loved it.............

I go back to the very beginnings of the ""microcomputer"" revolution and remember all too well the frustrations of dealing with monstrosities like CP/M, which most computer users today aren't familiar with and may be thankful that they are not.

  Microsoft brought and then forced standardization on the industry and that is a good thing, a very good thing.

  Microsoft's products, however, have ranged from the spectacularly and revolutionary great like Visual Basic to some real dogs. People tend to forget that Microsoft has not - and still does not - dominate every category of softwre.

  Office has, by and large, been pretty good. There have been a couple of releases that were terrible.

  Office 2000 and 2003, I thought, were excellent.

  Office 2007 is, in my opinion, something of a dog.

  Unfortunately, my business requires me to be intimately familiar with all the new releases of major products, so I don't have much of a choice except to use Office 2007 on a daily basis.

  So far my experience of a few days has been largely negative.

  I'm running it under Windows XP SP 2 on a 2.17 Ghz Core 2 Duo computer with 2 GB of fast RAM. Outlook 2007 loads like molasses in a very cold January. The search function in Outlook has been crippled. What used to be a simple search for the literal expression ""[Chicago]"" is now apparently impossible or I have simply been unable to find directions on how to accomplish. The search function is vastly faster and more flexible, but they seem to have dropped simple capabilities.

  In Word, Excel and Access, the new ribbon tool bar is jarring departure from Office's former GUI. Common functions, such as Undo are no longer immediately apparent. Many common functions, in fact, have been relegated to right-click menus or elsewhere.

  I have no complaints yet about the stability of the programs, but as I said, I've only been using them a few days.

  On the whole, if I didn't have to have total familiarity with Office 2007, I'd strip it off my machine immediately and reinstall Office 2003. Maybe over time, I will come to view the appearance changes as helpful. Right now I don't. Perhaps over time I will stop noticing how slow the programs are in comparison to Office 2000 and 2003 versions. At the moment however, I could read a chapter in a book by the time Outlook opens.

  Speaking of reading, Microsoft has once again changed the online Help format (which you can access if you find a terribly small button way on the right hand side of the window.) Help is less helpful than in previous versions mainly because it is too encompassing.

  Overall I think Microsoft has taken not necessarily a step backwards with Office 2007, but rather a misstep. If you can avoid using Office 2007, I would suggest you do so and wait for the next release, which I suspect will go back to looking more like Office 2003.

Having switched to Macs in the last year, and cursing everytime I had to port something over from Windows to Mac, I was actually quite surprised at how easy it was to transfer my PC QB data into this new Mac version.  From there, though, I find the program lagging behind its PC counterpart.  It feels more like a ""lite"" version that a full-blown version of the QB I've come to know and love.

I haven't had problems with it crashing as have others here, but I do take issue with the fact that some program functions (most notably reconciling your bank statement) to be frustratingly slow.  I've noticed that Intuit folks have posted comments here in response to some reviews, and have mentioned that the reconciling issue is a ""known bug"" they are working on.  Ok. That's not unusual for companies to rush a title to market before it's completely bug-free (ala Microsoft), but I was expecting the Mac interface to be as elegant as other programs that I've seen ported to Mac from Windows.

All that to say, this Mac version isn't terrible, it's just not great.  I was hoping for the robust Windows experience, and them some, in this Mac version, but I'm left feeling that the Mac version won't really come into its own until a couple of more upgrades down the line.

The QB approach to accounting, regardless of format, is still the best in my book, and believe me, I've tried them all.  While I haven't used the previous Mac version, so have nothing to compare with, I wasn't blown away by this version compared to the PC version.

It is the buy-once alternative to Office 365, and you have to decide whether to choose the Office 365 (which includes Outlook) annual subscription for multiple devices or this version for just one device. 365 also includes free support and Skype, which 2016 doesn't.

Oddly enough, although the ribbon is closer to the Windows version (which has also been tweaked and streamlined), Office has also adopted a Mac look - a task pane for certain functions such as styles, resizing, manipulating graphics, animations (PowerPoint), and formulas (Excel). Some gestures such as pinch zoom are also supported. You also get threaded comments in Word and PowerPoint, and co-editing features which allow several people to edit at the same time, alerting you to changes and conflicts (not real-time until they save, however). A document navigation pane provides easier, well, navigation, through page thumbnails.

Excel's new Analysis ToolPak gives you advanced statistical functions.

PowerPoint provides a Presenter View that lets you control your presentation from a different screen. You can also set up a presenter window to show notes, the next slide, or an overview of where you are.

The Ctrl key now also works instead of the Command key.

Unfortunately you are limited to OneDrive for cloud storage - no iCloud support. However, Office 2016 includes 15 GB of OneDrive, versus 365's 1 TB/user. Unlike the Windows version, you can't import PDF files. I miss the back-arrow button that Windows has - instead, you have the Mac-style menu at the top, which is hard to keep mousing to, unlike the Windows version which has it attached to the window. (This is a pet peeve which applies to the overall Mac OS.)

Some previous features are gone, such as being able to save a PPT as a movie.

Another problem was some occasional slowdown/hanging after pressing the Save shortcut.

However, no matter the problem areas, this is an office suite you will most probably want to get (or its alternative 365 version).","I was disappointed that Atari discontinued this product because the user didn't like the feature.

When you first get started with the program, to take full advantage of it, it takes some setting up. How detailed you want to keep track of your expenses and bills is really up to you. For example. I have every transaction from every credit card and I've attached the receipts to each transaction. If I pay a bill with several areas of charges, like DWP, I actually separate my charges for water, power, sewer etc, all attached to the single credit card transaction. I can go back over years and tell you exactly how much I paid my kids doctors and for what. I also attach key codes for software I purchase so I always have them and manuals for my appliances. I even download copies of all my insurance policies and attach them to the payments so I can always go back and review my coverage; the pink slip to my car attached to the payment, contracts for work I have done.
I can also keep track of all my bills, when the closing dates are on my accounts and the due dates on all my bills. I don't need to get a bill in the mail to know when it should have arrived and when it's due. I can set links to the web sites of all the accounts I setup so that I can go to each web site and see just want the charges are and download them into the account. One of the best things is, I can back up all this information onto one flash drive and have everything I might need in an emergency.","I have a lot of experience with water damage and I'm glad to find a program that provides the advantage of setting a time to do it.

I had the opportunity to grab a copy of Norton 360 and I am very glad I did. Norton 360 is exactly what an anti-virus software needs to be and offers protection in all areas of your computer. Last year I got a Toshiba Satellite that included Windows Vista (which is a pain already) and a trial version of MacAfee, I never understood how to optimize the use of the MacAfee application, it had too many windows and you had to upgrade different things at different times, I was relieved when the trial expired and I got to install a free application called AVG. AVG was good enough for what I needed but suffered from the same thing, 'if you want anti-spy ware you have to download and install this', 'if you want security using the internet install this other thing'...

I uninstalled AVG and installed Norton 360, first of all the installation was quick, it ran for over an hour (as I decided to have it scan my laptop while installing, if you decide not to it may take less time) Once I completed the setup and the application opened I went through the menus in one single screen which is great! The four areas in which the application is divided are in a single screen with submenus when you click over any of them, from this main menu you can scan, setup and even defragment your hard drive (the PC Tune-up feature helps optimize computer performance).  The time it has been installed in my laptop I have not noticed any slowness in performance and it has worked smoothly in the background while I surf the web or work in it.

One feature I liked is the 'Identity protection', in which you setup a profile with your personal info (including credit card number) and it will keep you safe when doing transactions online, you setup a password that Norton360 will require when doing transactions regardless of any security measures the web pages you use have. In my case I access my bank online to do transactions all the time and purchase from web sites, this feature serves as an additional security option. Norton360 also allows me to monitor my network and it even has functionalities that the software that came with my wireless router doesn't have!

Installation is easy, just put in the disc in your DVD drive and choose autorun.exe. (Sorry for mentioning the obvious) By default you get the Word Perfect X8 word processor, Quattro Pro X8 spreadsheet program, and Presentations for multimedia slide shows, and WordPerfect Lightning for note taking. In the original install windows they give you the option, as some separates install After Shot 2 a highly touted photo editing software, and as another installs a full suite of clipart, photos, and fonts. Once the initial install is complete it takes you back to the install window and you can click on the additional from there.

I have MSFT Office in my other machine WITHOUT the option to put it in any of my other machines. In all fairness I did buy the system builder version of Windows that allows only one install. I have a laptop, desktop, and a highly portable 10 inch HP X2 2 in 1. Fortunately with this Corel Office you can install it in up to 3 machines BUT only use it in one at a time. They keep track of this judicious usage by requiring that you have your computer connected online at least once per month.

So I am relieved that now I am able to use a Word processor etc. in the other two machines. In the user agreement (EULA) they only mention that you agree to use it in only one machine at a time. The 3 machines install information, and then checking on it via internet connection at least once per month I got off of a Corel user forum. By the way the additional included install of fonts places them in the Windows font folder so they are accessible to other programs and general usage.

When I bought Corel Draw X7 I found it to be a program that was profoundly easy to use in order to do the most popular features, yet the amount of depth in the program didn't leave you short with advanced features. Over time you can grow into the program as well.
With Word Perfect I was able to within seconds of opening the program immediately identify the top task bar icons and would highlight, bold, change fonts, color, etc. etc. etc. They even have a PDF creator built in.

I was really happy to see that it can open and edit MSFT Word files etc. I was also of course able to access the programs in this Corel installation from Remote Desktop in Windows. (Versions of Windows that has the remote desktop feature) I am typing this review via remote desktop in the WordPerfect X8 program.

I noticed the Grammatik built in spell check and grammar checker is not quite as robust as the one in Word in that is asked me repeatedly at times, jumping around from different words about correcting something. If I chose ignore or skip, and it went onto the next couple of words, it would come back to that one again. It is not that I wasn't able to use it effectively, and it did work, it is just that Corel needs to make that one feature Word Perfect. Hey I have to write an honest review. They also provide a standalone spell checker tool for doing just that. The Grammatik may be checking further terms and grammar usage further down the line, and then coming back to prior word usage, and that is why I am getting the doubling of some word checks. It doesnt work that way in MSFT Word. Maybe I just need to learn the ropes better, after all it is a new program.
Okay I just went back in and used just the spell checker and that behaves just like MSFT word in that regard. Grammatik is more comprehensive in that it checks grammar also. However, MSFT Word does both also.

All in all a very nice program. I love the ease of use, and the clear window, as well as the elaborate ribbon icons across the top that highlight their usage by scrolling over them. A little short window shows up with a quick explain. Highly recommended. I love Corel stuff.","I was reviewing the database for this release and found the installer to be very happy with the result.

My wife and I have always been pleased with having the larger screen and greater navigation control of a GPS program on our notebook as opposed to a small dashmount GPS.  If you currently have Delorme 2007 or newer I would not advise upgrading because this version doesn't offer any needed enhancements that we use nor have I seen much of an update to road data.

I love having the Plus version over the regular version because having all that directory information at my fingertips can really make traveling a lot easier.  If the kids say they are hungry, you ask Street Atlas where the closest restaurant you love is on your route and it will spit out a list of options.  Then you can call ahead and set up reservations because Delorme gives you the phone numbers as well as the address to the restaurant.

I have used both Delorme and Microsofts mapping programs and I am much happier with Delorme due to the ease of use of GPS navigation.  Also, I have found that Delorme's routes are much more intuitive to road conditions and always seemed to get us to our destination faster than Microsoft.

I REALLY wanted to like this game too! I'm a horse junkie, and a ND junkie, and I was all excited for the two to come together, but it just didn't work out for me, unfortunately. I'm going to split by review up into sections so I can give the game a more accurate rating.

PLOT - 4/5: Nancy is invited to Shadow Ranch, which belongs to Bess and George's aunt and uncle, the Rawleys.. But when she gets there, Bess and George are a no-show, and the Rawleys are in the hospital after Mr. Rawley got bitten by a rattlesnake. Nancy then learns that a mysterious glowing horse has been making nightly appearances at the ranch, and that everytime it shows up, a freak accident happens. She also learns about a outlaw named Dirk Valentine who, in the 1800's, was in love with a girl who lived on Shadow Ranch, and supposedly left her a hidden treasure somewhere. Could Dirk Valentine's treasure have something to do with the horse? Is there really a treasure? Who will stop the horse before something really bad happens? Well, it's up to you, as Nancy Drew!

This is practically the same plot as Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon (I guess it would be the other way around, cause this game came out first, but I played Last Train first so it's backwards for me) so it didn't really catch my attention. The plot was executed pretty well, though, but I still prefer Last Train. Everyone says how much fun the horseback riding was, but I didn't think it was that cool. You just point and click, same as always, except theres a horse head in front of you. But I will admit that by the end of the game, my horse Bob and I were pretty tight.

CHARACTERS - 4/5: The characters were good in this game. They weren't really THAT much fun to talk to (except Bess and George), but some of them were intersting. Tex is the horse wrangler guy, he's tough, mean, down-right scary looking, and he doesn't have much to say. Mary Yazzie owns the gift store near the ranch, her character was boring and her voice was really annoying. The cook, Shorty, was nice, it was funny how he always wanted to gossip with Nancy, but I thought he was creepy looking, like a big scary teddy bear. The foreman, Dave, was quiet, but it was really sweet how he had a crush on Nancy. And Charleena wasn't that cool cause all you did was talk to her on the phone. Overall, I think they did a good job on the characters, they weren't amazing, but the voice acting was good (except Mary IMO) and the graphics for them were also good.

SETTING - 4.5/5: This game is set in Arizona, and I think that the makers of this game did a great job getting that desert feeling. The decorations in the house were just perfect, and the ranch looked so realistic. The ghost town was pretty spooky, and the desert was barren, as it should be. The only problem I had with the setting was the music! The song was good at first but then it just got really annoying and repetitive. I would give the setting a 5 but for the song I'm gonna have to knock off half a point.

PUZZLES - 2/5: If you were to ask me what was the ONE thing that bothered me about this game, I wouldn't hesitate a second to say CHORES!!! I hated them! Fixing the wire and collecting the eggs wasn't so bad, but picking those vegetables, AHHH! I got sent home like 20 times for picking unripe vegetables. I mean really, who sends a guest home for picking an unripe tomato? I ended up printing out like a map of the garden from a walkthrough so that I knew which vegetables to pick. But those chores were just a total turn off. I felt like some of the other puzzles in the game were also hard, I spent like an hour trying to do that impossible magnet thing, then another hour hunting for arrowheads on the ground. It was just ridiculous. I don't know, mabye there were some really fun puzzles in this game, but I can't remember them cause all I remember is that awful garden. The puzzles in this game are really not my cup of tea.

IS IT CHALLENGING?: YES! Unless if your an expert at collecting vegetables, baking cakes, spending hours searching the ground for arrowheads, and solving invisible puzzles. I'd give it a 5/5 for challenge, but it's not challenging in a fun way.

ENDING - 4/5: The ending is good. The maze at the end is confusing, definitely challenging. And if it weren't for a walkthrough I wouldn't have ever guessed how to catch the culprit. I was kind of surprised by who the culprit was and what their motive was. Overall the ending was good.

FINAL SCORE:
Plot: 4
Characters:4
Setting: 4.5
Puzzles: 2
Challenge: 5
Ending: 4

So it was with much trepidation that I accepted a copy of Toast 14 for review, fearing the experience would be as horrific as the last.

So far the experience has been MUCH better!

Note: This is an Apple-centric review. I'm not sure how the features work on a PC, what capabilities the Windows OS already has, or what free tools are available for that platform.

Toast 14 installed and ran on my MacBook Pro running the latest El Capitan with no issues. Whew!
I'm using a third-party dvd/blu-ray writer (internals are Matshita) and it works great.

I've only had the chance to explore a small subset of all the features this software reports to do. There's so many different tools it would take a huge amount of time to go through them all. I will try to update this review as I get a chance to try out some of the other features.

The first thing I tried was the thing that gave me so much frustration last time: the ability to burn *HD* video files to standard DVD media (obviously the length of the videos is shorter - limited to 30 minutes). With this version, it worked the first time, my Sony DVD player played the HD beautifully, and I didn't have to buy a rip-off add-on. Hooray! This feature alone might be worth the price of the software.

IMPORTANT NOTE ON DVD MAKING: if you're trying to make a DVD of your home movies, note that every video clip you drag and drop into the interface will be treated as a *separate* video - so if you drag a hundred video clips, your DVD menu will have a 100 different movies and each one must be navigated to and selected separately - which is practically worthless for short clips. It would be great if there was a ""play all"" button on the DVD menu. TO GET AROUND THIS, note that in the Toast DVD UI there's a small option you can click that says ""play all continuously"". With this set, all of your clips will play sequentially without user interaction (excellent!). The only minor thing is that your DVD player will probably stall for a second or two between each video file change, but that's not a big deal. Your other option, of course, is to import all those clips into iMovie or some other editor and turn them into one giant video file. That will work great, but if you're using Toast to burn your DVD instead of iMovie, it's probably because you either lack the iMovie skills or your are lazy (that would be me) and just want to quickly make an unedited DVD of all your clips. Anyway - with that option set, it works great now!

I also tried the additional tools that run independently of Toast:

Disk Catalog Maker
This is a pretty cool utility for indexing all the files on your drive(s). It's a much more robust search tool than the built-in Spotlight. My only concern is that I don't believe it dynamically adds to the database as you add/remove files from your Mac. I think you have to manually initiate a re-scan for it to know about changes. Only time will tell if I use this tool regularly or not.

MyDVD
This is a basic DVD menu authoring tool. I tried it once and it built the disk fine, but when I played the disk back, the audio format was screwed up and all I heard was digital static.

Toast Audio Assistant
This is a handy little tool for capturing audio from microphones or devices and doing basic editing. The UI, while simple, was a bit confusing at first. I wasn't sure when it was recording or not. My only problem with this one is that it doesn't add much value to the package since you can download the free ""Audacity"" tool that is similar, but more powerful.

Live Screen Capture
This also worked fine, but I question its value to the package as it appears to do exactly the same thing that the free Apple QuickTime Player does.

So, I've only scratched the surface of all the features this package claims to do.

While I haven't tried to author a blu-ray, it appears you still need to spend extra $ to get a plug-in for authoring blu-rays in MyDVD. This, as used to be the case with HD-->DVD burning as well, is truly annoying as it's not revealed on the box packaging.

All in all, this is a much higher quality product than the previous versions I tried, although many features are available for free elsewhere, or are already built in to the Mac OS. But you may find that some features, like the HD-->DVD feature I talked about above are worth the price of admission alone.

Now if Roxio would only refund most of the money people spent on their earlier crap products and let them apply it to this purchase, they might get their reputation back.","I was really disappointed that Atari discontinued this product because I didn't feel like it had a real-life arctic.

An inexpensive file protection software described as a must to keep personal files from prying eyes.  McAfee is both intuitive and user-friendly, however, no instructions come with the installation disk and must be accessed online.  I would like to have been told how to transfer my sensitive files into the created vault without having to dig for this.

Installation was easy and the program is light on the amount of computer space needed.  McAfee requires a password to access the protected vault.  Once files have been moved into the vault, the locking process can be done manually or automatically.

This is a one-user software, so if you work from home and use a laptop, it can be installed on both.

A negative is that user support is only available for one year, and then you are required to purchased additional protection.

It should also be noted that this software does not eliminate the obligation to take whatever other steps necessary to protect your files such as strong password protection, avoiding computer practices that leave your computer open to spyware, keystroke recorderd and such.

Well that doesn't apply in this case, because I'm talking about a clean XP install vs. a clean Windows 7 install.  Previously we tried to make the laptop faster by installing XP from scratch.  That didn't help, but Windows 7 did the trick to speed things up.

  First I had to remove Norton and Norton's utilities and I didn't really like that. Then I had to remove the McAfee site advisor and SpyWareBlaster, all before the install would run.

  After I finally got it installed I don't know how well it will work since I cant get my computer to run at all. I've tried booting it up several times.

I shifted over to HRBlock (used to be Taxcut) after reading many Turbtax reviews that you can no longer use TT Deluxe for Sched D efiling for the 2014 version. TT requires you to buy TT Premier at a cost that is 2x that of HRBlock Deluxe.  I found HRBlock excellent and installed on my Mac quickly without problems.  It imported last year Turbotax files as well as Quicken for Mac 2015 files without error. I found HR Block easier to use and the import was more complete than Turbtax (TT) deluxe.  I am very happy with the shift to HRBlock. All of my fears of shifting tax software were unfounded. TT has gotten greedy and others should consider letting the market send a loud no buy message to Intuit (TT parent).  After using HRBlock I probably would not shift back to TT even if they dropped their price and made thier Deluxe version with the same features as their 2013 product.  I have found HRBlock to be an excellent product and accurate. I obviously have not yet tested the efiling portion of the program but I am assuming no glitches.

I've been using Microsoft Office since the Stone Age. After Word Perfect fell off the road from Take-Overitis, I made the leap to Office and never looked back. Now we have the current version from 2010. It is very nice and a nice upgrade from 2007 but the pricing model can be a bit unwieldy. It's expensive, there's no way around it. There's a lot of competition out there, some of it free, and a high price model is not good going forward. There is a Home version, but I use Outlook and have for years. So I need a Pro version.

Outlook got the biggest make-over this time around and I like what they did. The Ribbon-Bar is full of choices but not too troublesome to navigate. Still, with my mail now in the ""Cloud"", using Hotmail, I wish it was a more robust cloud interface. I still need to start on a now empty PST folder and click over to the Hotmail cloud folder. Overall though I still like using Outlook for my front end to my mail, but it is getting old. It needs a Cloud refresh.

Word and Excel are still the tried and true apps of this generation. They are the best and won't disappoint. PowerPoint is well, a clich&eacute;.

Each game is full of clues, puzzles, and exciting (and possibly dangerous) adventures. ""Scarlet Hand"" is no exception. In this game, you (as Nancy) take an internship at the Beech Hill Museum, and when a priceless artifact goes missing, it's up to you to find out what's going on. You'll explore the museum (which includes a pyramid with several levels, and an outside exhibit), and take the subway to visit several other key locations. You'll talk to various people, all the while knowing that one of them could be the thief. It's a really fun game; I've played all the others and this one took longer than the previous game (""Final Scene"") for me. It took about 10 hours on the senior level, and I was playing it with a partner. There are a lot of facts to write down and recall, and the puzzles in this game are very original. I was very pleased with the number of puzzles; just the right amount. What I really liked about this game, in comparison to some of the other Nancy Drew games, was that you didn't have to maneuver your mouse so much to find things. In some of the other games, you can only see objects if you position your cursor at just the right angle turning just the right direction. In this game, everything was very out in the open and the game was easy to maneuver; surprisingly, however, that didn't make the game any less challenging than its predecessors.

This software does not change much from year to year. The reason we keep buying it is that the ""online"" features expire after three years. Personally I am quite comfortable with this arrangement. This year's model features many bug fixes, according to the Intuit web pile. New features include a free credit report. I have not tried that feature, so I don't know how good it is. I found the upgrade installation to be perfect: no issues, no lost data, and reasonably quick.

It would be perfectly sensible to buy it every three years.

This is simply the best software of its kind available. Since Microsoft Money crapped out, there is no other software product that even comes close, in terms of features or usability. In my use, it is stable and dependable.

I believe that anyone with either a family or a decent income should use Quicken. Spending and saving your money involves decisions every day. It is better to drive those decisions with data than to rely solely on your instincts.

The modern alternative to Quicken is a fully web-based, free service such as Mint. You get what you pay for. You give away your privacy too.

Painter is a fairly powerful art program targeted at those that are involved in serious computer generated art, not the casual artist of picture tweaker.

The selection of media, from brushes to palettes, including charcoal, pencil, marker and paper, weaves provide the user with many options.

Technically, the installation was smooth and the control set is fairly common (Painshop, Photoshop and Painter share many of the same controls so the learning curve on the interface itself is pretty easy to deal with). Speaking of interfaces, a mouse is not the preferred user interface to take full advantage of this program; I would opt for a tablet to get the most out of Painter. After several month of using the program I am still learning the subtleties of various drawing techniques (in this respect the learning curve is much more steep).

Overall, this is much more power than I, a casual artist, need for what I want to do (fiddle some photos and author or tweak some website art) and much too pricey as well, but for the true artists out there this is a jewel of a tool.","I was looking for a product that will actually serve as your primary drawing tool, but I was not pleased with the results.

Vegas Pro 8, of course, is a much higher-end product than Roxio Easy Media Creator (version 8 referred to herein for comparative purposes), but here are some reasons why you may wish to reconsider:

1.  First and foremost, if you're serious about video editing and wish to explore new and creative ways to create DVD's, this one is a must.  Roxio will continue to place annoying limitations like 60 second menus.

2.  The controls are far more intuitive.  Creating a slow-motion shot in Vegas Pro 8 is as simple as ctrl+clicking and dragging a video clip to the desired length.  Roxio is a frustrating experience of playing with film speeds until the shoe fits.

3.  Playback while editing is no longer a processing problem with Vegas 8.  Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 (on a Pentium 4 2.6 GHZ Hyper-thread, 1 GB of RAM, and a 256 MB Nvidia GeForce 7800 card) has an annoying tendency to choke and run home to mommy when another process happens to run at the same time.  Vegas Pro 8 takes it all in stride.

4.  RENDERING.  OH, YES, RENDERING.  Roxio seems to think that everything needs to be re-rendered even if the edited video was already an MPEG-2 to start with.  VEGAS PRO 8 DOES NOT DO THIS - if it's already in the right format, it won't ruin the quality by recompressing.

5.  RENDER QUALITY.  Roxio offers constant bit rate encoding.  Period.  Vegas Pro 8 offers 2-pass variable bitrate encoding which allows longer videos to be placed on a DVD, while compressing it at a variable rate so that segments requiring higher quality get what they deserve and segments that are relatively static (i.e., pictures) can be compressed at a much lower rate.  Also, a 9 MBPS video encode from Vegas Pro 8 looks better than a 9 MBPS from Roxio.

6.  Capturing.  Vegas will tell me if my mini DV tape had dropped frames (and so far it has not happened at all); Roxio will not (and it HAS).  I'll make a DVD with Roxio and...surprise!!  I need to recapture that portion of the video because it's shot!!

7.  Bugs.  Roxio is buggy...VERY buggy.  Every time I try to make additional copies of a disc image that I put on my hard drive (because I don't want to live through another Roxio video encode), approximately 25-30 error messages (no, I'm not joking) will pop up that I have to repeatedly close out of before I can use the burn utility.  Not to mention that the initial install of Roxio caused my computer to forget that I had a CD-ROM or a DVD drive.  I had to edit my registry keys so that I could ""find them"" again.  Vegas Pro 8 has had ZERO issues with me.

There's more, but why go further?  If you're serious about video editing and production, don't settle for less.  This program will do it all from video editing, importing, capturing, image effects, DVD creation (including menus), and Dolby Digital AC-3 encoding (INCLUDING 5.1!!).  I have only scratched the surface of its full potential--there are plenty of tools to explore in there that can allow you to create very professional looking DVD's.

Buy and enjoy!!!!  And NO, this software does NOT have bugs as mentioned by Dash's review.","I had a hard time importing Roxio Protocols (which I now use) that I didn't like, especially since the software is so slow to download and run. It was slow to start the trial version of"

For years now I've been creative DVDs of pictures and movies for them to watch on their DVD players which has worked out well, but is often a time-consuming process on my end. A few years ago I started using PowerDirector and I was impressed. Year after year PowerDirector has been improved to the point where creating DVDs is a quick and almost enjoyable process.

I've used more expensive programs in the past, particularly Adobe Premiere... PowerDirector isn't quite as accurate and is missing a few features, however it's faster and easier to put together videos. I'm not looking to edit a blockbuster movie and what PowerDirector offers is perfect. My DVDs are usually just a picture slideshow with brief sections of videos in between.

No software can do the hard work for you of training your brain to recognize sounds, training your tongue to make them, and learning an entirely new set of vocabulary. But Rosetta Stone tries to make this process fun, intuitive, and simple. When you are trying to do something as difficult as learning another language, you don't need other difficulties thrown in your path. Attending a traditional class--driving, reading books, studying flash cards, interacting with other people who know the language just as poorly as you do--in my opinion introduces many more difficulties into the language learning process and is the cause of many people's failure to advance. If this is you, I recommend Rosetta Stone, which will allow you to advance beyond beginner level in a language in the comfort of your own home, using your own computer and the provided headset and microphone. When compared with the cost of taking a traditional course along with drive time and cost of books, Rosetta Stone's value becomes apparent.

Rosetta Stone is fun. At times, it can feel like a video game. The program does a good job of continuously challenging both your vocabulary and your tongue (as you have to pronounce the words more or less accurately) without being so difficult as to be dishearteningly discouraging.

Rosetta Stone immediately immerses the learner in the world of the language trying to make you forget your mother tongue (in my case English) as much as possible as you learn. This is, as far as I can tell, the best way to make oneself truly fluent. It is the way that I learned Spanish (total immersion), and in my opinion Rosetta Stone does as good of a job of that in a computer setting as I could imagine using today's technology.

I recommend purchasing levels 1, 2, & 3 together in a set so that you can advance far enough to actually begin intelligent conversations with native speakers. Rosetta Stone will only be able to advance you to a point, getting you out of beginner status. But to move on from there to fluent, will most definitely require surrounding yourself with people who speak the target language. But I am aware of no better value than Rosetta Stone to make that transition into another culture and language possible. I am looking forward to taking the next step.

I do have  word of caution from my experience regarding Windows Vista 64-bit software and Rosetta Stone's technical support. I was able to ""successfully"" install the software but unable to load any of the language modules into the software. After multiple calls (3+ hours) to technical support with a wide range of suggestions, I was finally told that Rosetta Stone is not supported on Vista 64 bit. This is somewhat frustrating and will likely be an issue more many purchasers of newer computers. I have read in reviews and blogs that some have been able to make it work, but I was unable to. I ended up having to install it on a secondary (and older) computer system. This was an inconvenience and something that I personally feel is an inexcusable oversight for high-end software. For lack of 64-bit support and the slowness of technical support to identify this issue, I have dropped my rating of the software from 5 stars to 4 stars.","I've been using this for quite some time. It was first introduced to me as a young learner, and I was delighted. After 2 years I tried it. Now I'm a big learner, and love it"

I think the problem is I am looking for features that the application just doesn't have?  It's also not very stable and I can tell you that it's not my system.  I built my system myself and it's fully loaded with a Phenom II triple-core processor, 4GB of RAM, Windows 7 and all the bell and whistles lovingly maintained by myself.  Yet, this hangs/crashes most of the time I try to use it.

First, starting with the photo suite.  I had a really hard time figuring out how to get my photos imported into this program.  Why can't it just use the Windows 7 libraries I'd already set up?  Same for videos?  I didn't find there was a whole lot I could do with the photos once I got them up and running (after several crashes -- maybe it doesn't like they are all on my home server on the network?).  Microsoft Live Essentials is free and it works much better and I can do a lot more with it.

Second, starting with the video suite.  I never really got this working.  It just kept crashing trying to load in movies.  I can load in the same movies into Roxio and Windows Movie Maker.  I had to give up.  I really wanted to test the editing features here.

Third, DVD/CD burning.  I wanted to burn an ISO to a DVD so I could install Ubuntu on a new system.  I never found the option for doing so.  Is there one?  I had to use Roxio instead.  I never got around to trying to take some home movies and make a DVD out of it.  Again, crashing/hanging.

Finally, WinDVD.  I'd heard all kind of good things about WinDVD, especially the Bluray support.  Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work with Bluray?  Maybe it does and I haven't figured it out?  Nothing seems to be intuitive here or it's so simple the features just don't exist?  Windows Media Center comes with Windows 7 and it can play DVDs.

So, now it's been installed for quite a while on my PC and I never use it.  I always go to Microsoft Live Essentials or Roxio Creator for what I need.  Eventually I will get around to installing it.

The trip planner was very fun and exciting to use as we could schedule side trips to take on our way to our main destination. While it was nice to have an option to send info to your mobile device, I think it would be great to have a full, mobile version of this problem.

If you want to plan a road trip with many stops, this is the best option out there. If you just want some basic mapping options, your best bet is the free online mapping programs.","I have been using this program for years, I was first introduced to it in Madera in the early 90's and for some years had them ship me the program until I found a suitable mapping program.

I want to be.  But, I'm not.  I do, however, have a need to create and customize graphics, especially for websites now.

So, I picked up a copy of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X4.

I've used Adobe Photoshop in the past, and although I know it is the industry leader among graphics software, I find it difficult for a novice like myself to learn.

When I call myself a novice, it is strictly in the realm of computer artistry.  I'm very adept technically, and work in the IT industry as a senior systems engineer.  I know software.

I figured that with the tutorials and help system in the CorelDRAW software, I should be able to easily learn what I needed to know.  Corel didn't disappoint me.

Not only are the commands a bit more intuitive than those in Adobe Photoshop, but the help system has quickly answered all of my questions so far regarding how to do anything I've needed.  Watching the video tutorials has helped teach me graphics concepts that may never have occurred to me to explore on my own.

The tools in this suite have aided me in creating custom banners, graphics, and editing pictures.  I've found the process to be easy and fun.

The program is a bit slow to open, even on a PC with a 3 GHz processor and 2 GB of RAM.  Once open, however, it responds very well.  The slowness to launch seems to be standard with such programs, however, so I am not sure it is really a fault with the software or if it is simply the nature of the beast.

There you have it - an amateur's perspective.  I'm not knowledgeable enough with graphics to review every little nuance, but for those of you who hope to be able to muddle your way through graphics creation, as I hoped, you will find this a useful and informative tool.","I have been using this software for years, and I have no regrets about it.

Additionally it comes with the option of converting it to a Windows 98SE desktop appearance, for those who don't want to fuss with learning new instructions to get the old things done. It does so much more though.
  One note of caution; do not install XP in an older machine, with older hardware. Your sound card vendor may have stopped making software drivers a long time ago for your now discontinued device. The problem is that they do not want to spend the resources to create drivers for a product that they no longer make. So if you have an old video card, audio card, modem, etc, it quite possibly won't work with XP. If you try to install XP you will get all kinds of incompatible error messages. So do yourself a favor and put old wine into old bottles, and new wine into new ones; consider getting a newer machine if you are going to upgrade to XP. You might wind up spending close to the same amount of money upgrading your components to make it work, as you would to just simply buy a new one. Check with all of your hardware manufacturers to see if they produced XP drivers for your existing hardware. Hope this helps.","I have a very nice operating system which is very easy to use.

The program is very intuitive, enabling artists to create exactly what they're after in a relatively short amount of time.  For optimal performance, I highly suggest using the program with a graphic tablet and pen.  Using a tablet with the program allows an artist to create really impressive illustrations, drawings, digital paintings and more, quickly and easily.

The program is easy to use, and the learning curve is not steep.  It doesn't take forever to learn where things are and how to produce different effects, and the artist can get right down to creating, instead of trying to learn the program.  Autodesk Sketchbook Pro 2011 is also  fast to respond, without painful lags or delays that tend to zap the creative juices and cause frustration.

I've previously used a wide array of video tools (Adobe Premiere Pro, Sony Vegas, Ulead VideoStudio, Pixela ImageMixer, Nero Vision Express, Pinnacle Studio, ArcSoft Showbiz, Virtual Dub and even high end expensive professional products like EDIUS).  Currently Corel's VideoStudio is the nicest I've used (of course this isn't completely fair as many of the other products no doubt have newer improved versions too).

I don't notice much difference between VideoStudio X5 and X9.  I'm sure they added some nice things but they haven't jumped out at me.  For me the biggest change has been the phenomenally increased speed on Win 10 64 bit vs 32 bit WinXP (much of this improved performance is due to the hardware though).

Batch convert is the feature I use the most.  This is an excellent way to convert files from one container and form of compression to another.

One of my complaints about all video editing software is a lack of in context explanations of the various choices.  How is a novice supposed to know the difference between H.264-Baseline, H.264-Main and H.264-High?

VideoStudio is easy to drag and drop clips together in a project and to drag and drop transitions between the clips to produce a nice final project.  A lot of tasks are intuitively easy (whereas other software leaves to reading through poor documentation to try and figure out how to do something).

Almost every company wants to sell you new version after new version year after year.  At least Corel provides some very nice (low cost) upgrade offers.  Certainly some of the time you'll want to take advantage of the upgrades to utilize new hardware abilities or a new software feature but generally I find it's reasonable to go several years between upgrades.",I have used a lot of software products because of the low performance of the video converter.

Other reviewers say the major difference between all previous versions and X6 is X6 has been recoded for 64 bit. I'm running the 32-bit version. As I wrote in my review of X5 Ultimate, there is little difference between X4 and X5, so they can pretty much be considered the same for contrasts in this review. As usual with PSP, you can run more than one version, even simultaneously. You can also install both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions on the same machine.

(Note: running the 64-bit version of PSP doesn't just require a 64-bit compatible CPU, you have to also be running a 64-bit version of Windows. Microsoft doesn't provide a way to ""upgrade"" an existing 32-bit Windows to 64-bit, you have to do a new install.)

As I noted in a previous PSP review, starting with X4 a change was made to the Pspimage format, so if you save in Pspimage format from X4-X6 and try to open the file with X3 or earlier, you will get a ""not a valid Pspimage file"" error. To avoid this you can Save As, select Type: Pspimage and then click Options below the Help button.

I almost exclusively do touchups of scanned books, repair of VERY old photos, and cleanup of photographs of old documents, such as removing ink bleed-through on old court documents from Ancestry.com. X6 Ultimate includes Athentech's Perfectly Clear.  Athentech sells it as a Photoshop plug-in for $199. After the plugin is installed it is accessed by Effects>Plugins>Athentech Imaging>Perfectly Clear

Face Filter Studio 3.0 from Reallusion is also included. Reallusion's website has a detailed description of the program's features, and it is not limited to mainly faces.  This is a standalone program and a major upgrade to version 2. Anyone who does a lot of portrait work might find Portrait Professional more useful, which is specifically for faces.

The video tutorials are a MASSIVE improvement! Help>Video Tutorials. ALL THE VIDEOS CAN ALSO BE SEEN ON A BROWSER at learn.corel.com.  So if you don't need the ""Ultimate"" bundled software and you already have X4 or X5 and don't need the extra speed from the 64-bit version, you won't be getting anything extra from going to X6. Along the same lines, a user named LeviFiction has over 65 X4/X5 tutorials on YouTube.

X6 still does not have photostitch capability (what Photoshop Elements calls Photomerge Panorama), which is not the same as PSP's Photo Blend function. Sourceforge.net has a free photostitch program called Hugin. If you just do photo touchups, etc., then you probably won't care about photostitch. But yearbooks routinely have individual ledger-size photos (17""w by 11""h) that the average home scanner can't handle in a single scan.

Something annoying that goes back several generations is that Image Information for a PNG file automatically displays in metric units and that can't be changed.

X4 originally came with only one workspace color scheme, similar to Photoshop Elements--medium gray on black, basically illegible.  Corel quickly did an update that increased it to four schemes, which it kept in X5. X6 has gone to just dark gray (like Elements) and light gray.  The main menu bar has the Elements color scheme for both options.  I find the menu text a bit small to read comfortably (24"" monitor at arm's length).  In X4/X5, although the type size was the same, with the Light Gray workspace scheme the menu was black text on a medium gray background, which stands out a lot better.  Perhaps with an update they'll add back the other two color schemes and change the main menu bar in the Light Gray workspace. When cursoring over a Main Menu option it does change to black text on gray and the various drop-down menus are black on gray.

One thing I do like about the new Light Gray workspace is that prior to X6, ALL the color schemes had the basic work area just slightly lighter than solid black. Photographed documents (e.g., old U.S. Census pages) often have a white document and solid black background. It could be pretty much impossible to distinguish black in the image edges from the workspace. The new Light Gray option has a light gray work area.

EVERY TIME you click on Help>User Guide (PDF) it downloads the 8Mb guide (224 pages) to C:\users\[username]\AppData\Local\Temp\ -- even if you already have the PDF open. The address where the PDF is located is not stored in the Windows Registry or in an ini or xml file. Several times I opened X6, clicked on User Guide, then closed the Guide and X6, then reopened X6. I wound up with FIVE copies of the PDF in that temp folder. The installation doesn't install the User Guide and create a start menu link to it. So if you want to store a copy on your computer you'll have to hunt it down from the above path and copy it and add your own link.

Corel's website has local help available as a download for X6 so you can access Help when not on-line: From the home page > Support > Patches & Updates > PaintShop Pro X6 > X6 Help files

==================
ORGANIZER: I only started using Organizer recently, to keep track of a bunch of genealogy documents. In Organizer's Navigation panel, data about images in Computer is *not* stored in the Organizer datatbase, it is read from the specified folders. Data about items in Collections *is* stored in the database. If you don't realize this, it can give the impression you suddenly lost DOZENS of tags.

I have X6 running under Win 7 Home Premium and X5 under Win 8.1 Pro with Media Center. The organizer *Collections* database is fully transferable. You can Export the database from one version and Import it to the other to keep them in sync. You have to run Import/Export *within* PSP. However, when you run it it tells you PSP has to be closed. It will then close PSP, import/export, then automatically restart PSP. The export (backup) is stored in a ZIP file. There is no option to automatically  add a date, etc., so it always offers to export under the same filename.

The application stopped working for me over the weekend.  Launching MyDVD put me into a never-ending loop of Windows Installer popping up.  I haven't touched the configuration of EMC-10.  Trying a repair in Control Panel | Add/Remove programs failed asking for files on a network.  I can no longer create DVDs without getting one of many obscure error codes.  The knowledgebase article at Roxio support about the installer loop said I needed to completely uninstall the product from my PC and reinstall.  The uninstall took forever because of the myriad of components EMC-10 installed without a unified uninstaller.  I am definitely NOT reinstalling this software.  I have never had an experience like this with any software package I've installed.  No way I am putting up with it.  I will be requesting an RMA today.  I am going to try Adobe instead.  At least they have a 30-day trial without having to pay up-front.  ZERO STARS!

[Original review:]
I downloaded the install for EMC-10 and was able to install the software, get it to run without crashing and produce a nice DVD from movie clips and a photo slideshow complete with background music.  This is the only part of the suite I've used so far and it worked brilliantly.  I would even say it was ""quick"" and I am using a Dell 9300 laptop with a Pentium M 1.6GHz processor and only 1GB of RAM.  I live in fear of trying the other parts of the application until I upgrade to 2GB.

The DVD burning and editing went much faster than MyDVD 5.5 and actually worked unlike MyDVD 9 (see below).  The end product is really good looking with only a few issues.  The things I don't like about the final DVD product is that the main menu music will not play for more than 60 seconds and the highlighted menu suffers from all kinds of aliasing problems with the font.  I also noticed the first few notes of any background music for a menu is lost.  The video quality is very nice taken from Motion JPEG files and 3ivx MPEG-4 files from a Canon 850is and Flip video camera, respectively.  The background music sounds great encoded as AC-3.

The nightmare was all before getting EMC-10 installed when I upgraded from MyDVD 5.5 to MyDVD 9.  Today a software package is no good without a good website, documentation and tech support.  So, while this part might not seem relevant I would beg to differ.  First, I had no clue that EMC-10 included MyDVD 10 or I certainly would not have bought MyDVD 9.  Nothing in the EMC-10 product pages indicated MyDVD was inside and version 10.  I also didn't know that MyDVD 9 would not support the files recorded from my Flip video camera.  Once again, nothing on the website saying that it does not support 3ivx MPEG-4.  Nothing on the website indicated any of this.  I figured it out reading the forums from other users.

If anything does go wrong with EMC-10 I already know I am hosed trying to use their website, documentation or support.  I am still waiting for a response from their customer support on my refund for MyDVD 9.  The instructions on their website for getting a refund don't work at all.  It can't even find my order number.

Five stars for the product features that I've used and minus two stars for the website behind the product.

[Update:] Roxio has a click-to-chat feature on their website.  I got a service rep right away and he gave me a phone number to call Digital River - the Roxio online store.  I called the number and after about 3-4 minutes on hold talked to a friendly agent who promptly sent me to a link where I clicked a couple of buttons to get my refund.  I got an email today confirming my refund for MyDVD 9.  No questions asked.  If only my call later with Comcast had gone so easy :-).","I tried it for two weeks and found nothing useful.

However - for Vermont, where there is a property tax ""prebate"" that residents must know to apply for...TaxCut does not have the forms one needs AND they do not tell you you need the forms.  SO - I would never  get the $550 ""prebate"" that I was entitled to this year, except that I knew about it from previous tax filings.
Also, it bothers me that in order to get my ""prebate"" I had to fill out downloaded forms by hand after searching for needed information in my files and using a calculator to get some needed totals.  To me, this is NOT what I should have to do after spending over $65 for a Fed./State/e-filing program!!!
Besides, if Turbo Tax can fill out these forms automatically and have these same forms in its State of Vermont Tax Program - what is wrong with TaxCut doing the same thing???  (I chatted online with TaxCut's customer support about this problem and they told me (a week ago) that there would be no updates to their Vermont program and that they ""do not include all needed forms"" in their program.)
NOW, wouldn't you think it is important to know about and be able to file forms HS-122 and HS-144 when you might get $500 or more back for submitting them?
What does this say about TaxCut and their completeness of tax preparation software?
What does this say about TaxCut's concern for their customers????
It tells ME that I need to go back to Turbo Tax next year - even with its installation problems - and save myself the hassle of handwriting information on self-downloaded and self-printed forms and not have to print an envelope and stamp it -- from now on!!

Point being I can't comment on the Download approach.
My only gripe with Intuit (not this package, per se) is the $40 gouge price for an additional State.  At thathigh price, it's got to be a super-high margin item for Intuit's bottom line.

Pinnacle's Studio 18 has 3 different versions: Regular, Plus and Ultimate.  This version is the Plus, and is their mid-range program.

I don't like the fact that these programs literally take over the entire Windows operating system and funnel EVERYTHING YOU DO thru the Norton servers for inspection. I also don't like the fact that putting this heavy weight software on a Windows computer can, and does, slow the machine down dramatically. Hence, I limit myself to using on Norton Antivirus, which I really do like.

My goodness... I just set up a new Dell computer for a friend (who is somewhat computer challenged), and he insisted on Norton 360. I installed Norton 360 on his new Dell, after deleting the default antivirus software Dell puts on their computers. And I was a little surprised at the efficiency of Norton 360. I didn't seem to be the big elephant in the room. It was much quieter, less annoying and ate fewer system resources.

I suppose this is an improvement that deserves praise. BUT I still don't like giving up complete control of my Windows operating system to Norton 360. I'm sorry, I just don't.","I am a diehard aficionado. I love the little computer and its easy to use.

This package is good, but the truth is that if you have ever bought a camera or camcorder, you probably have software that will do at least 80% of what this does. So the question is, how badly do you want that additional 20%? And how much of that 20% would you really use?

For my part, if I really wanted the extra 20%, I would want a program or suite that would do 80% more than the free stuff. So while I wouldn't caution someone against buying this, I also can't particularly recommend it either. There are simply better alternatives out there.","I have a problem with software that seems to run out of steam when I use this package.

I do video editing with Adobe Premiere Pro CC so I wasn't expecting a huge amount of features, but I was pleasantly surprised to see how much WAS offered when in Advanced Editing Mode... the library has quite a decent set of transitions, overlays, text editing and control of background music. Obviously there are pro features missing (such as shaping the envelope of a transition) but honestly, you can produce quite good output with the NLE. The output options are numerous too, where you can either pick a specific resolution (720, 1080) or simply pick the device that your project is intended for.

I tested the ""Create video from webpage function and it does work. The utility windows shows what video it's capturing from the webpage you are playing it on. However, bad news and this isn't Roxio's fault: it doesn't work with YouTube. YT constantly changes where temp video is staged while its playing plus they hide it deeper and deeper every month it seems. So this software won't capture YT but not many can.

The real power of Creator 13 is the media handling... you have every option to burn and copy DVDs and CDs including options to write the image to the hard drive first for more stable data (always check that box) as well as verify the disc afterwards (always do that too, although it adds time). You can open ISos and burn them right to disc, make data discs and assemble and produce audio CDs. This module alone is worth its price, not many utilities give you all of the options for  data and media handling.

Not So Good: format conversion. I took an .MP4 of a music video that was in 1080p and told Creator to convert it to iPhone 6 Plus format. When I previewed the new file the audio was out of sync. That may not happen for every format, but it'd take quite a while to test every conversion format. Since I have Adobe Media Encoder I'll use that, but for the general audience who doesn't subscribe to the Adobe tools, I'd look elsewhere for video conversion. Apple Quicktime Pro is a good start.

For the money it's a pretty good package, the file and disc handling and the web capture are the redeeming features. The Free Movie Maker on Windows along with QuickTime Pro would handle media creation and conversion but you wouldn't have the disc authoring ability (Menu page on a DVD for instance) nor the disc features, so as an all-in-one solution that won;t break the bank, this one is working well on my Windows 8.1 PC (i3 running on an SSD and 16GB ram).","I was using this at my home and found the perfect set of presets that are easy to use.

Each iteration sees improvements and version 11 is no different.  I am someone who prefers typing over dictation, so I am not a heavy user of this product.

My first experience with the Dragon software was probably about ten years ago.  At that early stage voice dictation was more of a novelty than a professional work flow.  Things have improved exponentially since, and this version impressed me with its accurate recognition (after training of course).

Before you get started the software needs to be ""trained"" to your voice.  And while the training process has improved, it will still take some time to get it accurately interpreting your voice.  Account for that during the installation process as it will take an hour or two to get everything tweaked and adjusted.  Is the accuracy perfect?  Definitely not, but it's pretty close.  I tend to be a fast talker but Dragon was able to keep up most of the time.  Corrections are easy too.

For those with repetitive stress injuries or other disabilities, Dragon's software also brings voice control to a number of other functions, including email and search engine queries.  Short queries tend to be very accurate.

The included headset is a bit inconvenient for desktop users in that it uses analog connectors and not USB.

There is a GuideMe feature that will walk you through the setup so you'll feel more confident when you set up your small business account. I had a friend who had more than one of those grrrrr moments with QuickBooks 2010, so for the neophyte to the program this is a real plus. If you've been working with the program for years it will be of no consequence. If you are satisfied with the last couple of QuickBooks versions, I wouldn't recommend upgrading, but otherwise you might want to consider the 2012.

Two other things, in addition to the actual content, sold me on the viability of the program. One was the access to instant online assistance. I wanted to check out a question I had and when I went to the QuickBooks site there was instant access to a tech. The program is easy to use, but if you do have more complicated FAQs, you can get up to an hour's worth of time with a QuickBooks expert during your first month of use (888-222-7276) . These aspects are perfect for the ""beginner."" You may also wish to take a look at QuickBooks Pro 2012 to see which program best fits your needs.

I wouldn't say this program is perfect, but there are several new features that are helpful to the average QuickBooks user.

* The calendar feature. You can see invoices that are due on any particular day and and information that was entered. For example, you can see what needs to be done or what has to be done including emails, faxes, and appointments. You can select what you want to see from a drop-down menu from one thing to all transaction. These are details in a panel below the calendar.

* The document center. It's now much easier to attach documents than in the last version of QuickBooks and at no cost (it came out in 2010). You can add a document from your computer, scan one, or drag one in. For example you can drag in a picture copy of a check to go with your invoice. These do need a separate backup that is not provided.

* The Lead Center (under customers in the drop-down menu). You can add your lead information (lead name, status, company name, main phone). You can add many things such as Facebook, Twitter, Skype, phone numbers, etc. When you want to contact them you can put them in your calendar. There is also a place you can make notes on the lead. If they become a customer, you can just click in the corner and the information will go into your customer base. You can also import your other leads.

* Batch Timesheet Entry Function. Timetracking must be enabled, time data needs to be turned on for all employees you want included, and you need to use the Weekly Timesheet Function. This function is a bit tricky because of the prerequisites and necessary similarities in pay. For example, the employees need to be working on the same job and be putting in the same number of hours. There are online tutorials that are very helpful when you wish to implement this extremely useful feature.

* A list of memorized transactions. There is a detailed list of what you may or many not choose to be entered into your program. You can choose when you want to enter them.

* To Do List. These can be arranged by type (calling, faxing, emailing, appointment). They can also be prioritized and there is a notes section to use.

* The ability to export reports to Excel so that they can be formatted is a very nice feature. You can update an existing spreadsheet. The information can be pull from QuickBooks into Excel.

* Wildcard Search. When you go into the customer center you can narrow down and select certain customers. For example, if you want to find a list of active customers, but don't know a particular name you can do a keyword search. If you know the customer's name is Joe just enter it in and his information will come up. You don't even need an exact match to get a hit.

Like anything, it depends on what you are looking for and the reason you need it. If you want a place where you can centrally organize your records and have them ready come tax time this is probably a program that will do just that. If you want online billpay included, don't bother because it isn't here. I love many of the new features and so do many of my friends. If you have a small business, I think you might wish to add this one to your list. The learning curve is not steep, the program is fun to play around with, and there are many online tutorials in addition to the expert help from QuickBooks. If what you need is in the program, I'd highly recommend it.","I like the fact that I don't have a computer anymore, so I bought this to serve as my accounting software.

I had 360 until I installed this new package. Plain and simple, I miss 360 and its features, such as the file and registry clean-up utilities. But I can live without those.

My biggest complaint? It keeps crashing in Google Chrome. I don't feel fully protected. I get regular messages of ""This plug-in has quit working. Do you want to stop it?"" or ""Norton has crashed. Reload page?"" SEVERAL TIMES a day. When I am working or playing or just whatever. It has also slowed down my Chrome page loading times. So no, I am not a happy Norton user and will probably uninstall this and buy 360 despite this version being free to me for a year for my honest review.

It reloads fairly quickly--or appears to--then it crashes again a few minutes later. I am using it on two different computers--a desktop PC and a laptop PC and it does this on both devices. I am wary. I don't feel safe. I am NOT inclined to try the password vault feature after all of that. Which doesn't lead me to recommend the product.

I'll give two stars because I like the concept of covering all the devices I use, but after using it on two, I won't be loading it onto the rest. Yuck.

To be fair, the system caught a bad app from messing with my computer after a rare bad app kerfuffle-I usually avoid those myself with internet savvy but this one got through--shortly after installation. Another reason I am sticking with the two stars. It saved my cookies once.

I do have family members asking me about some of these programs though so I started it up again. Our verdict is very basic, with the understanding we used it for very basic effects.

The Auto Effects are pretty cool. They essentially take a realistic photo and turn it into something that is akin to an art project or painting or any other affect you'd like.

Updates are obnoxious. You can't just update from within he software. Corel requires you to go to their website, sign in and then grab the file.

As a whole, Internet Security Pro seems to do an admirable job of protecting my Windows Vista computers (another good aspect: this will protect up to 2 computers).

Where Internet Security Pro really seems to fall down (though I would suspect that Windows Vista probably should take some of the blame as well) is in the resources department.

I find that it has many great features, with some quick ""wizard"" type capabilities, but that the real worth of the system is in the detailed editing capabilities.

I have been using VideoStudio since X3, so I was basically aware of how it works. For the beginner, there are excellent tutorial videos available, and there are quick movie applications, and a method to quickly generate picture shows. They also include a program to capture the output of your screen, which would be useful for training, or just sharing what you are seeing.

For advanced users, there is the stage. It has the typical elements, with video track, overlay track, title track, voice over track, and music track. The tools include project templates, transitions, titles, background patterns, special effects, and paths (used to make items flow a certain pattern). Most of the tools have literally dozens of options, all of them visually presented so you know what is being done to the video.

Once the video is edited, you can share it to the web, create an ISO, or make a DVD. It can create high definition DVDs. They have options for creating for mobile devices, computer, web, DVD, and 3D. A wizard takes you through the process of creating menus and chapters for DVD options - which can also be customized.

I found that the rendering engine is very fast, and makes full use of multiple processors. It is the fastest I've worked with.

The one thing you need to realize is that it will take some time to master the program - there is a lot of stuff here. Personally, I suggest creating a test project, and applying the effects and etc to see what they do. I've always found that doing is the best learning. It is how I learned the Corel system when I started, and a few hours of dedicated practice will lead you to appreciate the capabilities.

Summary: Powerful and a bit complex - but the results are worth it.","I was using this video for several months and found helpful for me. I had to double check and then, after editing, I found the right kind of editing. I wasn't happy, but thought it was a good method. I"

After shooting 3 hours of HD video during a family wedding, I wanted to put together a decent disc as a gift to the bridge and groom.  There are a ton of products on the market, but this suite and its companion website community is significant.  I started with the AVCHD formatted video extracted from the MINIDV tapes and didn't know how to use the interface and tools.  Opening the help system takes you to the web based manual and instruction system, but I wanted more of a personable approach to the tools.  Thankfully Cyberlink has a significant amount of ""how-to"" on Bing Video and YouTube.  After an hour of watching the educational videos, I was clipping my raw video into sections, using the Wedding express project to begin my menu and transitions.  By far this isn't a difficult tool to use, but its massive.  Only by reading the manuals or by online videos will I even know all of the features and options for setting up my video, and I'm duly impressed with the amount of options installed by default and custom and user shared content and objects on their powerdirector community website.  I'll probably have 10 hours into this wedding video by the time of this review and I'm tempted to hold off on the final cut until I watch a few more use videos to ensure I didn't miss anything.

Of the features, cleaning up the video and stablizing the video added the most value to the non-tripod video that I used as source.  While my Sony Cam has great color, my lighting wasn't always ideal, and the brightness levels of some dark shots was easy to lighten to get a better view inside the reception hall.  Transitions and animations were outstanding.  For those that are looking for a full featured video editing and compositing solution, this seems to cover everything that an amateur would want.

For those worried about system specifications, my system is a Windows 10 4th gen i7 with 16GB of memory using SSD storage for editing.  My graphics card is an Nvidia 860 based GPU and I didn't have any issues in editing a 20GB m2t AVCHD source file and all transitions.  I'm encouraged to get a nicer gopro or handycam to continue with sports video of my kids... my next project will be taking video clips from my Canon Rebel T2i and Samsung S6 from this summer into a compilation video.

While I experienced some lockups and freezing, it didn't happen that often.  What prompted me to switch to XP was a desire for better memory management (Windows 98 doesn't do a very good job), more stability even though Win98 wasn't bad for me, and an overall change of scenery.  So finally I made the plunge, doing a clean install instead of trying to upgrade over 98.
The Upgrade Advisor that you can download from Microsoft.com was very useful.  Luckily everything except my NEC printer was compatible with XP.  Next, the Transfer Settings and Files Wizard that comes on the XP disk also came in handy.  It gathers all your settings and/or files from the ""old computer,"" saves them in a file (or transfers them directly - you have various options) which you can then put on the new computer.  I wound up transferring only settings using the wizard.  Originally I told it to transfer files too, but it copied too many things that were unnecessary and the result was way too big to fit on a cd.  I would advise copying your documents and other important files manually but letting XP transfer your settings.  That way you can be more selective about what gets transferred (assuming you are doing a clean install).
Installation of XP went very smoothly.  It identified all my hardware, and I was able to reinstall my software with no problems.  Using the Transfer Wizard to move the settings to the new installation worked fine and was a real time saver - it moved all of my internet and e-mail settings and messages over with ease.  All user input was very clearly explained and the process overall was quite simple.
Using XP: There's a lot I still have to learn, but so far the system has been stable and I notice memory is managed much better than under 98.  It loads faster and while the much more colorful layout took some getting used to, now it seems like 98 is in black and white by comparison.  I also use the ""clear type"" option for fonts and find that they are easier to read than under a ""normal"" display (it seems to me that the main difference is that clear type makes it darker and bolder).
I'm glad I made the switch.  I've read some complaints about installation experiences and also the strict registration requirements but my experience so far has been all positive (knock on wood, of course!).  It seems like the Microsoft engineers really gave this a lot of thought and put it into action.",I have a hard time using Windows Server 2008 R2 with over all of the major operating systems on the market.

Actually Id used a couple of different versions over the years. All of them required extensive effort spent training the Dragon before you could actually use it. Often, it included problems with the Dragon understanding my accent. With this version, there were none of those issues. I read one short paragraph and proceeded with the rest of the set up instructions. I also did the short tutorial. Once that was done, I opened a word document and proceeded to start dictating to it. It had very little trouble understanding what I was saying. Because of that alone, this is definitely a five-star piece of software.

Now once its installed it is a wonderful piece software use, but the installation was the slowest installation of a program I have ever done. I was installing from a DVD, and it shouldve taken just a few minutes. However its been about 15 minutes with me wondering if the computer had frozen up. While my laptop is not top-of-the-line its also not bottom of the barrel and it is new. It uses Windows 8.1 operating system. Overall, I think it took 30 to 60 minutes just to install the program. I actually cooked dinner waiting for the installation to complete. Then, I had to come in and do the registration portion. At least the registration is quick and easy.

In the long run, I guess the slow installations worth the effort because the program is a very quick to learn to use. For people who never use Dragon NaturallySpeaking for used to take me weeks to train the program before it was fully usable. With this version, it took minutes. I have not learned all of the slight nuances of using Dragon yet, but it seems very user-friendly so far. Im thrilled at the ability to continue to write without causing pain in my arm. I highly recommend this program for anyone who has difficulty using their hands or arms for typing and mouse usage. It won't completely eliminate the need for keyboard or mouse use, but it makes it much easier to compose on your computer.

All software has a learning curve. This new version of Dragon speaking naturally has a very short learning curve before you're able to start using the program. Over the next few weeks, I anticipate learning a lot of the finer details of using the program. The only downside is when your spouse continues to talk to you and the mic begins to pick it up. Right now its a little bit slower than when I type myself, but with practice, I anticipate becoming quicker. Hopefully, one of the things that I will learn to do is how to edit a completed document by voice. Im thrilled with the program though.

As for what comes in the box, there is the DVD for insulation, a small booklet, and a headset. The headset has a mic of course. Its not the best headset in the world, however, it does work well with Dragon. Thats the headset that Im using right now as I compose this review with Dragon.","I've had to use this for several years. After using the Macare I decided to buy the full set of emory programs.

Learning to use them is a real trial.

I moved from Adobe's Captivate, a program I truly enjoyed using, to VideoStudio 11.5 Plus, because of Adobe's insistence on flash video.  I'm finding that it may be easier and quicker to find a good converter program and convert my videos to flash rather than continue to struggle with VideoStudio.

While feature-rich and compatible with many video formats, the documentation for VideoStudio is poor.  The User's Guide is small and packed with tiny print and graphics.  While I feel sure that everything possible has been included in the Guide, reading such tiny print while trying to follow along online is extremely difficult.  Searching the Corel website for video tutorials produced a few but not enough basic tutorials for the program.

VideoStudio 11.5 Plus is a good program (from what I can tell so far) at a reasonable price, especially when compared to alternatives offered by Adobe and Sony.  It is my hope that Corel will add many online tutorials so that customers will be able to develop their skills to take full advantage of all the features the program offers.

It also has filters and algorithms that will automatically convert your photographs into pre-selected styles (e.g., watercolor).  The program gives you controls of numerous parameters and is quite powerful for the price.

I have toyed around with it using a mouse and also a Bamboo pad and pen.  Both work well.  You don't have to be a whiz to get in and start fooling around.

Yes, it was easier to splice and change dimensions in my free Windows Paint program.  Also- the object removal tool left too many artifacts from surroundings.

First, I'd like to start by dividing my review into two factions.
1) The game itself
2) My personal detective work.

* PART 1 *

PLOT: A shot back into time as we are on the cusp of the Great Depression [1930] in Nancy Drew's latest adventure mystery.  What can we learn from this era? What timeless things are ours to explore in the town of Titusville [in the midwest]?  I found fascination about this time warp, but actually learned nothing unique as I used the tools and ideals brought out from that decade.

INITIAL SCORE: 85

CHARACTERS:

Emily Crandall:  Nancy is out to learn from a friend of a friend what is upsetting this teenager and soon is on a two-part mystery that involves theft of family jewelry and a possible forgery of an estate will.  Emily was definitely distraught as she dealt with insecurities of being financially defunct, her mother passing away a month prior, her odd new guardian, and strange things happening to her [moving framed pictures and voices in her room].  I never got the sense she was insane; just tense. Emily did lose a bit of control at the end when she verbally attacked Nancy; I didn't take too much offense in that, although I probably should have.

Jane Willoughby: This is Emily's mother's best friend and she got under my skin right from the start.  Her Minnesota voice was out of place I felt and the strange lingo of ""What's cooking?"" irritated me to the fact that I avoided her if I could.

Richard Topham: Spitting image of John O'Hurley http://images.playbill.com/photo/o/h/ohurleycue200.jpg  and the resident ESP paranormal psychic that continues to practice on the grounds.  He was close colleagues with Josiah Crowley, the eccentric rich man who owned the Lilac Inn and is now the direct benefactor of the will that is now being contested.  I thought it a little arrogant to have him infer I needed to pass a test in order to converse with him, but I also found it fascinating since I aced it!

Jim Archer: This banker was my #1 suspect, because there was something about his financial dealings he won't making clear to me and he seemed friendly in a bizarre way.

Carson Drew/Bess:  This was the most grown up I have ever heard from Nancy's dad as compared to the later versions where he sounds less gruff and slightly younger in his views. Bess was the same delight as always.

CUMUL SCORE: - 1 = 84

SCORE/GRAPHICS/SOUND EFFECTS:
Totally different from any of the other ND adventures which is quite obvious. I didn't say it was an excellent score necessarily, but I give HER points for bringing out the era's style.  Graphics were decent, though learned nothing new about the era except perhaps the roadster and black/white photos of the early 20th century after the first World war.  Sound effects and detail of the ladder being sprung in the barn were fantastic.  The businesses and residents of Titusville were hugely entertaining as you delivered telegrams in the adventure. I loved Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farms, haha

CUMUL SCORE: + 2 = 86

PUZZLES/MINI-GAMES: The golf game was strangely not as fun as I would have imaged, although I loved the golfball color challenge. Also not as enjoyable as I thought was the conversation cue ESP test. It took me a long time to integrate the sentences Richard spoke with the traditional card symbols. The Hobo puzzle was easy and okay. I like the test in the parlor involving the slider Shakespeare characters.

CUMUL SCORE: Even = 86

ADVENTURE ENDING: I wasn't totally compelled with the plotline, but I wouldn't necessarily say I was bored neither. Thank God that the telegrams weren't a required evil the entire time as that would have made the game extremely tedious.

CUMUL SCORE: + 1 = 87

* PART 2 *

I try to solve cases without any hints, walkthroughs, etc, even if it were to
take weeks! Well, it took me three days [9 hours] and I gave myself a
Detective Score Of : 75

My Strong Points: The games were completed at a steady pace and I rarely needed help from the walkthrough although I had trouble finding out where to continue the adventure after being derailed mentally sometimes.

My Weak Points: I did not guess the culprit!!!  I didn't think I was that off-base, but I WAS so I have to give HER a bit of credit for stumping me [something they hadn't done in the last seven adventures thus far].

OVERALL GAME SCORE: 87 + 75/ 2 = 81 [ B - ]

BOTTOMLINE: Cracking the Top Ten says a lot for a Franchise that is pushing to get its first A level type game, but at least we know that HER is trying to stretch its boundaries. Good Job and keep going!

Norton has fit the bill for many years. Norton does require renewing your licenses every year - as do most other makers of virus protection - but I feel that I get something for my buck as they constantly add additional features.

I used the disc to download the software and it was hassle-free. (I see that others commented on downloading from Norton's website to ensure that you're getting the latest version, but I find the disc download much easier and faster)

I don't own a Mac or any Android devices, but really like that Norton extends protection to iOS as I can now protect my iPad and iPhone. Five licenses will be plenty for most households. I think the Scream Alarm is nifty for locating my constantly missing phone; Remote Locate is also a nice feature if your device is stolen but Find My iPhone/Find my iPad apps on Apple products do essentially the same thing.","I have been using viruses on my computer and I was not able to find them.

Bottom line, this is a very easy to use and fun program for basic media file editing.","I've used this for a lot and I've tried a lot of things.

This year I took advantage of getting part of the refund as an Amazon gift card with 10% added to the value of the card. The gift amount goes into your Amazon account and is the default method for paying for things you order so you don't have to remember to use it or make any effort at all to use it. Use this for $1000 refund and you have gotten back the cost of the software plus the filing fee plus made a small profit.,I used this software because it's free and available to purchase as soon as I have used it. I had an advantage over other vendors when it came to getting a refund (as long as the credit card is still valid). If

I'll try to be as much non-techie as possible.

I have evaluated numerous products, available today in market. From Norton to Norman. After due considerations, which essentially depends on cost + features I bought this product.

I was pleasantly surprised. Let's review in more detail --

1. Anti-virus : The product has a very, very good anti-virus protection. For those who know, nowadays the original virus infection has ""died down"" considerably. This is because, viruses need a way to propagate, which earlier was floppies, then emails. Nowadays all email providers have good enterprise-level scanners preventing the spread of viruses and with broadband a detected virus is neutralized quickly since info. 'bout the virus is quickly dissapated and scanners upgrade themselves realtime.

2. Firewall : The best in the market, I mean it! With the network protection + OS firewall protection available - it means that if this is installed from day-1; all available ports (TCP/UDP) are by default blocked. The good part: The pop-up encourages 2 options - Temp/Perm. of either opening / blocking the port. Thus, user doesn't get repeated msgs. I used a particular component called SNOOP; which basically tries to find open ports across the network. Tried to Snoop into the ZA protected machine - not sucessfuly. Used SNOOP to GO OUT from ZA protected machine, ZA provided pop-ups for each such attempt.

3. Anti-spyware and privacy protection -> very, very solid.

Here's the BAD POINTS -> There should be a background scanner, which scans the CONFIGURED options in program control, component control, etc. to determine those that are (a) No more valid as (maybe) s/w has been un-installed/changed (b) not used for a very long time. Those should be cleaned automatically. Why ? As time passes by, due to large and large amount of data residing in these 2 sections, more and more time is required to load ZA.

-> Bad backup options available. God forbid, if you have some issues requiring re-installation of ZA. Then you'll need to re-configure everything from scratch! The backup and restore option do not restore everything.

-> Game mode : Not very clear in it's use; for upon using it; found spywares entering the systems.

-> Poor support for Firefox - Although firefox is more stable, however there should be more in-built protection from ZA towards Firefox.

-> Cache cleaner : Not very complete, leaves a large number of MRU lists un-cleaned.

Terrific points : Absolutely the best firewall protection and identity protection suite available. It's the customer exp. that matters. When (for ex.) an user wants to protect his name; all other products I have evaluated have their pop-up popping up each time. ZA pops up; you select ""Allow always""; bingo it's done.

Next - the expert rule features; helped me to configure advanced settings so much so that when I am in Extranet (VPN) I can access my office network comfortably without sacrificing on security.

FEATURE REQUEST - A gateway service as part of the firewall, whereby ZA can act as a software gateway for all browsers, thus effectively protecting the real IP address.","I am a certified security expert.

I was offered this product to try and...well, it works fine.  It takes a little getting used to because of the interface being different but my papers get printed and delivered just like I do it in Word, and my spreadsheets look great.  I also have not found any problems opening Word or Excel documents with this program.  Since I'm not using it in an office environment, I can't review the other special features involved but I have to assume that they will work fine if I ever need them.
Overall, I like the product and would highly recommend it to anyone needing an office suite of sorts.","I've used a lot of computers since I was a teenager, and I had a lot of problems with mine. I bought this because it seemed easy to use. I had a lot of resources at my school and I"
anti | virus | software | protection | vulnerability | difficulty | installation | program | hesitation,"Unlike other anti virus software I'd been using, Bitdefender Internet Security updates hourly as opposed to two to four days. It also has settings protection and vulnerability scan which my other programs both did not have. As did the other programs, it also has parental controls for households with children.

I didn't encounter much difficulty during installation, though I did need to uninstall my previous anti virus program.

Because it is superior to the program I had been using, I am very satisfied and happy with the  many functions of this software program.

I recommend Bitdefender Internet Security with no hesitation.",I have been using Antivirus software for years and I was first introduced to it in Madera in the early 90's and for some years had them ship me the software until I found a way to order in the U.S.

First, I've been a long time user of Parallels. I run a Macbook Pro (previously a 17"" from 2008, now a 15"" with Retina Display) mostly because they're well done and because of Parallels (and now VMware Fusion) allow me to run Windows at the same time without having to dual-boot it.

All the major functions work well and as expected. Once set up, you're able to run the host OS with the VM OS at the same time and, as you'd expect, performance is based on how well your machine is ready to handle two OSes (memory, CPU, HD space, etc.).

Install:

One thing to note. My new MBP is on Mountain Lion (wonder if the next release is going to be Cougar or Sabertooth?) and apparently version 4 out of the box (I've had this for about a month now so they might have fixed this with the current stock) won't install. You have to go to the support site, register (for obvious reasons) and you can download the proper installer (4.1. X). You need to register since the installer is a full installer, not a patch. Once you're registered it's currently under Support & Downloads > Product Downloads > All Downloads > VMware Fusion (right column mid-way down). The link is here but bear in mind this might change:

[...]

Once you've got that downloaded, it'll install just fine.

Retina Display + Windows 7 (and others?):

Another problem I had was screen resolution. Retina displays, if you aren't aware, effectively mean you've got double the original/standard resolution (basically twice as many pixels). That's what gives the displays the clarity (more pixels per square inch = better resolution). Unfortunately, this apparently doesn't translate well into Windows in fullscreen mode, at least as of this writing. There are a couple of workarounds so it's not the end of the world and it appears that working in windowed mode (and in a sense in Unity since Unity's got to scale to the Mac OS anyway). Not the end of the world, as I said but definitely something that will need to be worked around until they patch the software.

[...]

Unity/Windowed Mode Switching:

This is a minor gripe if only because it felt a lot easier in Parallels. Switching between Fullscreen, Unity and Windowed Mode is a bit odd. It takes some getting used to (you'd think a couple of well-placed tip bubbles would've been part of your initial experience with the app). They've got two different buttons in different places. It took me a little bit to get used to. Again, minor but you'd sort of think it might be a great design concept to just put them together and in a consistent location so you can just find it fast and do what you need to do. In addition, once you switch to Unity mode, you basically lose the Windows desktop. You'll have to pull up the Windowed Mode to find stuff, including taskbar items. There's a start menu in the Mac OS site with Fusion but I don't see a usable taskbar (I might be missing it). Again, this is just a pet peeve and might not amount to anything for you.

All in all, it does what it's supposed to do and appears to do it well. I haven't tried 3D graphics/gaming with it yet so I can't really speak to that. Compared to Parallels, honestly, they both have all the same major features. I feel like Parallels did a better job of handling the ""mixed mode"" between the two OSes but I don't have a recent version (last version I used was 4 or 5). However, if you're wondering in general if Fusion will work for you, I can say it will. VMware's been doing VMs for a very long time. A decent amount of cloud infrastructure is running on VMware (though, obviously, not Fusion).

So, while I can't give you a good Parallels versus VMware comparison with current versions, I can say VMware should deliver what you need if you want to host Windows on a Mac. Just remember a couple things: a) you need to own a copy of Windows to run a VM with it, and b) you should have enough resources on your Mac to give up some to run a VM--there's no magic here...VMs run on whatever resources you allocate to them so giving them 1 CPU with 500MB of RAM and 10 GB of hard disk will mean it'll run fine if all you want to do is check e-mail. At minimum, pony up for more RAM and a nice sized hard disk, especially if you're going to run Windows 7 (I recommend allocating the min requirements depending on the version you're running). You can still run on less than minimum resources, it'll just be a slow ride.",I've been using this for a couple of years now and this is the only salient feature that I notice that I don't have any cpu resources available. I also like that it comes with a few extras

This software upgrades the interface from previous versions---but in a good way, as it is a lot more intuitive.  Basically, allowing me to capture, convert and copy digital media is a BIG plus.  A nice feature for CD burning, is that it will automatically split up large numbers of songs over multiple CDs without the need for you figuring out how many songs you can actually burn on the disc.  So, you can just keep clicking away and it will figure it all out for you---and allow you to create multiple copies all at once.  I found the software to be slow at some times when burning large amounts, but it did get the job done.",I have been using this software for years and I was first introduced to it in Madera in the early 90's and for some years had them ship me the interface to the Windows 10 operating system (which at first appears to work fine with

It really gives you an amazing value and loads of the newest features and abilities.  If you don't want to spend over $350 for Sony Vegas Pro or over $700 for Adobe Premier Pro, then this Corel VideoStudio Pro is one of your best choices.  It has more features that any other sub-$100 video software program out there.

Compared to Adobe Premiere Elements 10 (Adobe's comparably priced video software), this software is just as easy to use but offers you many more options - like all the DSLR photo and videos features, the ability to work with huge video resolutions up to 4096 x 2160 pixels, ability to process the newest AVCHD 2.0 and AVCHD 3D video formats, Alpha Channels, slow-motion, and (most impressively) out of the box Blu-Ray video and disc rendering.  Adobe and Sony both require you to purchase another software program to render videos for Blu-ray discs.

To make this software even better, I haven't had it freeze up on my yet - which Premiere Elements would do too often for my liking - and the rendering process is faster.

Usually when companies release sub-$100 video software they give you dumbed-down versions of their pricier full-blown software... such as Adobe and Sony.  You lose features and get a product that leaves much to be desired.  Corel however has done it differently with VideoStudio Pro X6.  You can many of the great features that top level software has at the low level price.  I'm very pleased and plan on using this as my new video production software.","I was really happy with this product. The price was right and the software program was great.

Still, screen changes within a website exceeding one minute were not unusual.

I had to leave the system on constantly because after shut down or to reboot would consume anywhere from 15 minutes to over 1/2 hour. I was also disappointed to discover this ""upgrade"" meant sacrificing all of the functionality I had come to appreciate with Norton systemworks since the first action that is performed in installation is wiping out that product, not to mention the initial loss of any spam filtering.

Both McAfee and Norton have gotten a reputation for gobbling up system memory and slowing performance with their anti-virus engines.  Both of them have also rewritten the code behind their latest security suites.  In addition to much more efficient anti-virus engines, each of them has added more functionality and loosened up their offerings to provide the option to secure your entire household with one license if you choose to purchase the 3-user version.

Keep in mind that once you install the 3-user version on one machine, the clock starts ticking.  So you have to use it for 3 users concurrently.  You cannot install it on the same machine for 3 years in a row.  Like most anti-virus products, the license includes virus definition updates for only one year.

Unfortunately, there are still some shortcomings that make these programs less ideal for power users.  As time goes on, more and more home users are starting to fall into that category.

Over the past year I have been testing a variety of security suites and anti-virus programs for a work-related project.

I only want to provide a context for how I came to some of these conclusions regarding McAfee's relative strengths and weaknesses.  Some of the strengths make this a good program for hands-off home users, but more demanding users may want to look elsewhere.

The biggest improvement that McAfee has incorporated into their product is a much more efficient scanning engine that is more resource friendly than prior versions.  In terms of *online* scanning of files, this program runs faster than most alternatives.  It also uses less memory, at least for the anti-virus engine.

But in terms of system impact, there still appears to be a performance hit from using this product for certain situations.  Certain types of internet applications just seem slower.  It also adds a noticeable delay to the startup time.  I tested clean install images with updated service packs before and after installing this program.  I speculate that some of the other elements of the program, such as the anti-phishing and anti-spyware, may be using other processes in memory and slowing down performance only for applications that trigger them.

Ironically, it seems like those components do not work as well as the included alternatives in competing programs.  Testing these out in a lab environment, the McAfee program was one of the slowest to detect spyware and phishing risks for known vulnerabilities.  There are some additional features that can compensate for that on the enterprise version of the product, but on this one you just have to accept that it is slightly slower at detecting those things.

The ""Total Protection"" version of the product also includes a network aware component that may appeal to SMB customers.  That program is supposed to detect rogue network devices and similar risks, but I have seen poor to mixed results with it.  I suspect there is overhead in this program for those features included in Total Protection version of the product that haven't been activated here.  I can't be 100% sure, but considering how much faster the anti-virus engine runs it is one possible reason why there is still a slowdown of system performance for certain situations.

One other thing that I noticed was that the newest version of Norton Internet Security has a much more detailed application firewall.  For those that use many complex internet applications that require custom settings, that program offers more granular control for those willing to dig down into the settings.  The basics are all covered here, but it is not as easily reconfigured.  On the same token, the default setting of the program requires constant confirmation for the system to adjust security settings for your applications.  It is possible to limit these warnings, but the configuration is not set ideally out of the box.

CONCLUSION

The strengths of the program are the improved easy to use interface and faster anti-virus scanning.  This 2009 version will definitely use less system memory than prior versions, at least directly.  It seems easy to punish McAfee and Norton for their past sins, but both products have improved slightly in that regard.  But you still have to decide if you really need some of the cleaner interface and faster scanning of these products, since there are free products that will do the same job and save you the annual subscription cost.  Also make sure that you know what features are most important to you.  If you need more control of your application firewall settings, you may want to explore the alternatives.

Good luck with your software purchase.

I had originally hoped it would be a viable desktop OS going forward but unfortunately it seems this is not to be. Microsoft made some much needed changes to the desktop experience after the Windows 8 disaster, however they did this at some expense to the touch experience. The user interface continues the flat, sparse trend that started with Windows 8. The icons look like placeholders hastily drawn in mspaint and the whole interface just feels stripped out, sparse and unfinished with huge amounts of screen-wasting white space. The result is an operating system that still doesn't come close to Windows 7 on the desktop and isn't as good as Windows 8 on a touch device. On top of that, it throws out any performance advantage Win8 may have had over Win7, and it feels more like a platform to push Microsoft subscription services and paid apps than a desktop operating system. Then there are the mandated updates which are not limited just to security patches but can include arbitrary changes to the UI or features. In a nutshell, by obsessing over this one OS, one experience across the board, Microsoft has created the Spork of operating systems that tries to be everything to everyone and doesn't do a particularly good job at anything. They seem to be doing their best to throw away their desktop dominance in order to chase after mobile in a battle they already lost.

But I broke down, after swearing never to use Norton again, and purchased the 2009 version. Wow, what a change to the better! This software has a process during the initial installation download that removes any prior Norton software links in the registry and cleans it up, for the download of the 2009 version. I had to do a manual shutdown, due to this process sticking during the scanning process for an excess of 25 minutes. But when it rebooted, it promptly completed the process and advised that all prior Norton remnants were removed.

I have had several computers and am now using a Dell Dimension 8300 3 GHz , INTEL CPU with 2.5GB memory with XP Pro AND a Dell Vostro 1000 laptop 1.8 GHz with 1 GB memory and AMD64 CPU with XP Home.  I used McAfee starting in 1991 when it free from a bulletin board and then when it was bundled for a fee, then started using Norton Systemworks 2000 - 2005 (which all included anti-virus), Norton Professional anti-virus, Windows Live One Care, Norton Anti-Virus 3 user 2007 , 2008 and recently 2009 when I couldn't use the PC Tools Internet Security program.

I decided to try to install PC Tools Internet Security on my laptop because I keep it pretty clean, transferring files to my desktop computer.  The install disk took a very short time to install - that was nice. BUT...and this is a pretty big ""but"" for me...No matter what I did, my WLAN card was of no use -- Windows kept closing it because there ""was a problem.""  I couldn't register the program because I had no Internet -- because my wireless was not usable.  Because I could not activate the program, I could not use it for updates yet.  I could not access the Internet to find out what the problem so I could not activate the program.  A catch-22 situation.  No Internet meant no program.

I went through all of the settings and told the program to give full access to my WLAN card but it never worked.  No matter what I did I could never get to the Internet.  Made me mad.

A little aside -- when you are asked to activate the program you type in your name, your email address and the multi-alpha numeric product key.  When you click on activate, you are met with -- sorry but there is no Internet and it keeps your email address but you must re-enter your name and product key over and over as you try to register your product.

I never recognized most of the items the lists of choices showed so had no idea if I should allow or block them.  Even with the Zone Alarm Firewall I used to use I knew what most programs were for.  The software didn't seem to block my Explorer browser but did block items like Linksys EasyLink Advisor.  And I guess the program also blocked my WLAN wireless card.

As soon as I uninstalled the program -- which took two tries and two reboots, my wireless access magically came back along with the Internet.  What a relief!  But now I had no Anti-Virus protection.

The software seemed promising -- I thought there was a nice thick manual inside the box -- apparently the manufacturer thought that the heft of the box might lead buyers to think there was something in the box besides a disk.  I couldn't believe it -- a 4 1/4"" X 5 1/2"" X 1/2"" thick notepad with a link to ""special offers for retail customers.""  There was a small flyer with instructions on how to install the program and a few other instructions as well but the manual was on the disc.

Since my Norton Anti-Virus had expired (I will never again wait until my current anti-virus program expires to install a new Anti-Virus program so I can use the old one until I get another new program) I ended up downloading the free version of AVG and going to Costco to buy Norton Anti-Virus/3-user software so I wouldn't be without protection on my two computers.  No waiting until low sale prices with rebates or anything a/c I was desperate.

I see by the other reviews that most were able to use the program after any difficulties.  Maybe they are all IT's or MIT graduates.  Programs shouldn't be this difficult.  I thought the program should be more intuitive and not block everything on your computer so you can't even use it.

We have a fairly simple estate (we own our house, and have very few belongings that need to be designated to anyone in particular - one or two family heirlooms, and that is really it), so I feel comfortable doing a lot of the documents provided in software package myself.  Once I've completed those I want for our family (will, financial power of attorney, health care directive, etc), I will print them out and make an appointment to meet with a notary to make sure they are viewed as official and enforceable.

The WillMaker Plus 2013 has a huge toolkit of legal documents at users fingertips and helps to guide you in making your important decisions.  It also comes with a handy legal book that you can physically flip through.

In addition to life-event documents like the health care directive and will, it also has more common legal documents such as a bill of sale, child care agreement, child care instructions, Do Not Call (putting your name on the do not call list), subscription/membership cancellation form, and SO MANY MORE!

I love feeling empowered without needing to meet for hours with a lawyer, which really adds to the expense of planning out your life events.

In short, for an easy estate, this is a great tool, provided you remember to print and have your documents made official by a Notary Public.  If your estate is more extensive I would probably use this as a starting point, and then bring some of the papers to a lawyer to make sure you are on the right track.","I have a bug bug problem that seems to last forever.

MapPoint is a must for the serious / business users; it has all the features of Streets and Trips plus powerful data mapping, information analysis, and communication tools.

It is very powerful.  You can basically search by street to any location in the USA and Canada plus it also has street level coverage of Mexico.

It is easy to use.  You can type in a street or just click on the map.  You can put in start and end locations and MapPoint will map it all out for you so you can streamline those travel plans.

If you want to see detailed data information on different areas such as age, population, etc. then this program has it.  This is great for business users so you can target certain products to certain areas.  You can also use the maps etc. in your Microsoft Office applications (such as Word, Excel etc.) to create your own specialized documents.

Once you get rolling then you can plug the GPS receiver in your car into your computer and then run MapPoint in the full screen navigation mode to follow that route you already planned earlier.  It even has voice direction.

I found the 2008 version for 3 computers for two years at a great price.  When it was running out, I went looking for a similar deal and found one.

I noticed a couple of unpolished elements when installing.  There were a lot of DOS command prompt windows opening in the background on the screen very briefly.  I didn't have to interact with any of them and they went away almost immediately so there's no harm to it.  It's just a little unpolished.

I should also mention that the update for it is big.  It will ask to download the updated installer, then after a few minutes when that's downloaded and run the updates for the program are currently over 75 MB.  I think that's probably the case with many anti-virus programs, but just be aware if you're on dial-up you'll be downloading for quite some time.

I uninstalled that old&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2008-version/dp/B000V809KW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2008 version</a>&nbsp;from a laptop and a desktop.  The desktop went fine, but the laptop failed to uninstall.  I tried to get the uninstall program off Bitdefender's website, but the link they pointed to was dead.  Eventually, I found the CD and reinstalled, which failed, but the CD had the uninstaller which worked.  I only mention this because it's a little worrisome that if the last program had those issues that this version might when I eventually uninstall it.

I like this version of the program.  It has several different modes ranging from Novice (hides settings) to expert (showing all of it) and is very easy to change between them.  My absolute favorite part though, is the ""you're not fully protected"" system.  In past programs I've used, if you disable some feature you constantly get the little alert icon that you're ""at risk"".  Bitdefender 2010 lets you choose which of those things it monitors for.  So I didn't want the anti-spam because I only use web mail, so I told it not to bother me that I'd deleted it.  It may be a small thing, but to me it's a huge annoyance saver.

So far, I cannot tell if the scanner is faster or not.  It scans at only about a quarter of the number of files per second as the old program, but it supposedly has an intelligent monitoring system which lets it avoid rescanning files that haven't changed and thus couldn't have picked up an infection.  So while it wasn't that fast on the first scan, in theory it'll only get faster moving forward.  It intentionally skipped thousands of files.

Default is a daily scan, which in my opinion is complete overkill.  Unless you have a kid in your house, if the resident protection is running all the time you can get by with once or twice a week.  Thankfully, the scheduling is very easy and you can even set the scans to take low priority, which is a nice touch.

In terms of detection, BitDefender isn't the highest rated scanner, but it's far from the lowest.  It's an excellent budget anti-virus package and more than adequate for most people's needs.  Considering how reasonable the pricing is, I'd happily recommend.  However, since I've only used it a week or so, if it does do anything really weird I'll update my review to mention it.

release | approach | desktop | provide | choice | interface | option | computer | version | application | download | ap | clearance | learning | curve | preference | star | learn | time | start | menu,"Microsoft did not learn much from its earlier abortive Vista release.  Windows 8 is a completely new approach to using Windows and it hampers function for desktop users to assist tablet users.  Windows 7 and XP users will be frustrated and often lost.

Microsoft was negligent and typically arrogant in not providing an alternative choice to select a more intuitive Windows 7 like interface option under Windows 8 for desktop users.  If you are so frustrated with Windows 8  that you are ready to reinstall Windows 7 over Windows 8  or return your new computer for a Windows 7 version, a good application that makes Windows 8 a little more usable and makes it operate more like windows 7 is called Classic Shell and is a free download (another ap is Pokki).  Ironically, Windows 7 computers are not any cheaper, although they are being clearance out, because of the high learning curve with Windows 8 and associated preference of desktop users (as apposed to tablet users) for Windows 7.

On the positive side, Windows 8 is more compact and a little faster and a little less buggy than Windows 7 (why it got one more star than one only).

Those that are willing to retrain and start all over learning Windows with Windows 7 and take the time to customize their start menu, may eventually like Windows 8.","APK is a relatively new approach to providing desktop software.

Once Office 2010 and Windows 7 emerged I really fely like Microsoft finally got a robust environment of operating system and apps, that worked well and did great things easily. I expected the same from 2013, but once installed I discovered that the game has changed, some good, some not. If you're a 2010 user and are thinking about the 2013 upgrade, there's a few things to know. I'm a software developer by trade, so I'll try not to get TOO lengthy with this, lol.

Office 2013 and taken the same direction in it's user interface as Windows 8 (to be expected), and to enjoy using 2013, you'll want to be in the new mindset that Windows 8 promotes. It's kind of hard to separate the two, and here's what I mean: Win8 is now more of a ""live"" operating system, where you login with Windows 8 on your PC but with your Microsoft Online Account which authenticates you (this will apply to Office 2013 in a sec, hang with me). Then you are auto-connected to several of Microsoft's services, one of the big ones being SkyDrive, their online cloud storage. For the record, SkyDrive is just like DropBox which most folks use, except that SkyDrive gives you more storage for free and upgrades are way cheaper than DropBox and iCloud (can you believe I just said that regarding a Microsoft Product??) Right away, just by using Windows 8, the game has changed because the online dependency is so prominent. That does have a few advantages and comes into play with Office, in this way: Office 2013 does mostly look and feel like Office 2010 (except for color scheme, I'll get to that, my #1 gripe about 2013), so knowing your way around won't be a problem if you're used to the Ribbon of 2010 and even Office 2007. But Office 2013 has some new things that will make life truly easier in some areas. Given that, here's the Pros and Cons of Office 2013:

PROS
Integration, Integration, Integration: because of the whole online connectivity thing and the built-in support for SkyDrive, Office 2013 is SEAMLESSLY connected to SkyDrive which makes document control about as awesome as it gets. You store your docs (Word Docs, Excel Spreadsheets, etc) on your SkyDrive, and you can kiss the USB Thumb Drive goodbye forever, because any computer you use will automatically sync your docs as you change them or add/delete. It's more than just using DropBox because you don't have to constantly navigate to DropBox folders, SkyDrive access is in every area of Office 2013. PLUS, your settings for Office (background color, default fonts, etc) are all synchronized across all of your devices as well, and that includes all the iThings from Apple. I use OneNote for everything on my Win7 PC at work and my Win8 PC at home, plus on my iPad and iPhone, and every device is synchronized really well. I always have my ""everything"" with me now. That sort of integration is missing from Office 2013. This is a common workflow model being adopted by major software companies. Adobe has done the same thing with Photoshop and their other apps (I use almost all of them) in their new CC model. Same thing: doc and app synchronization.

Another plus is being able to post your docs to Office365.com, which you automatically get access to. This allows a person that doesn't have Office installed to read your docs from a web browser, makes changes, and have it sync back with you. Working on a wedding invite list with your mom who is across country and has a Mac with no Office? No problem, she just needs a web browser and she can work on the same doc with you.

These two features are huge. Office 2013 does have other improvements in how you Save and Open and Preview but all in all it's similar to 2010. You DO get access to a lot more online templates in 2013 which is nice.

Now, the CONS:
-Outlook's mail interface: It's always been great, but now it's getting downright confusing. Microsoft has been offering grouped messages for a long time but now you're never sure which one is what you should reply to. It becomes apparent after you hunt around once a conversation gets long, but it's just a little too cluttered on screen. Inline replies seem to add to the mix. That's just my take, others may like it. I prefer straight email sorting by daye & time. I can still do that but it takes some setting up in Options.
-The WORST PART: The User Interface: Everything is so WHITE now, just like Apple did with iOS7. The options in Office 2013 allow for Light Grey and Dark Grey, but it's only slightly shaded. Dark Grey does NOT get dark like Office 2010's Black setting. Everything is so bright and lacking contrast in 2013. If there wasn't this excellent inline integration, I would ditch this in a heartbeat, seriously. I have tried scouring the hard drive for theme files, Registry Settings, SOMETHING to get the grey a darker shade but no go. Do a Google search on that, people are frustrated and Microsoft is silent on it. Why not just give us a dark theme, what's the problem Microsoft?

Integration is great, User Interface is a bright mess. It's still a 4 star app for what it does, and I'm holding out that Microsoft will provide a way for us to Theme Office to our own taste. Let's hope they listen.","I was not happy with this user interface, and never used one. I used it for work on my Mac Professionnel. It's all good, right?

I rememberd much preferring it to the early versions of Word and MS Works, but that's not saying a whole lot after so many years. Since that time I had become accustomed to Microsoft Office XP and then Office 2003, while more recently using Oracle's open-source [...] project (which is a great option for many home users). I have grown tired with Microsofts GUI updates in their last two versions of Office, so it's nice to see Corel go with an interface that's instantly recognizable to anyone who's used a word processor without any ""Huh? What's that button there for?"" moments. Word/Office may have been a more intuitive and user-friendly program at one time, but that ended with Office 2003.

Document compatibility is another area where WordPerfect Office X5 excels. Of course it has its own file format, but it also supports Microsoft's new OOXML formats, as well as [...]'s ODF formats. While that's not an absolute guarantee that it can open every file properly (especially when it comes to Word document formatting), that does make it one of the most compatible Office suits right out of the box, without having to download any kind of viewers or file converters (which Microsoft can't even do between its own lines of products). In fact, out of the box Office X5 supports over 60 different file types.

WordPerfect X5 is what this suite is named after, but the other applications are also noteworthy, particularly Lightning, which acts as a document organizer and information manager. Quattro Pro X5 and Presentations X5 do pretty good impressions of Excel and PowerPoint, respectively, while Nuance Paperport 12 SE is there for document scanning, imaging and management (please note that this version of Nuance Paperport is not really the full version, some features are limited). If there's one weakpoint, it's the inclusion of Mozilla Thunderbird. While it's a great e-mail client (I use it at home), it's simply not good when compared to Outlook when in a Microsoft Exchange environment. Thanks to Microsoft's proprietary files, Thunderbird just doesn't seem to be a good match for Exchange, when it's even an option. Sure, there are ways to configure it to make it work, but it's hard to recommend it over Outlook in that case. If you run a small business and just need a simple e-mail client for POP3 and IMAP accounts, then it gets a hearty recommendation.

All-in-all, WordPerfect Office X5 is a recommended and much more user-friendly affair than recent offerings from Microsoft. Throw in the fact that it's a good bit less expensive and has a wide breadth when it comes to office suite compatibility (it can handle anything the MS Office and OpenOffice can throw at it), and it may be the best bet for your office.",I have been using this product for nearly a decade.

In fact, the whole process went quickly and it filled in and calculated our taxes. It was able to handle the HSA account info I had for two of the year's accurately and without a glitch. This was what had caused the problem with Turbo. It also took me through itemized deductions, interest and dividends easily.

The interface isn't as graphically appealing as Turbo Tax, but it's easy to use and did my taxes accurately. I was able to download the state version for free and it took less than 5 minutes for it to install, get my info from the federal taxes and fill it out. Both state and federal seemed to go faster with H&R and it was very straightforward. I'll be using H&R Block from now on. H&R has a feature that can get your info from last year's Turbo Tax if you decide to switch over.","I was trying to find a disc that would actually hold my $$ in my account.

I have advanced computer skills, but that isn't enough when you are working with graphics  you also have to understand the artistry of the task. I don't know if I will ever be more than an amateur when it comes to this kind of technical work, but luckily Corel helps me be better than I am at it.

Ive used several Corel products in the past, and one thing has stood out for me above all other features with this brand  they really make an effort to hand-hold their users through the software. The software has all the power to satisfy advanced users (I am taking the word of a friend who is proficient with graphics editing) but they don't turn their nose up at people like me. Ive honestly found Adobe Photoshop a bit intimidating  I haven't used the current versions, so I am speaking of older editions of Adobe Photoshop. I have never felt this way about Corel, at least not for long.

Corel includes built-in help to guide users through the plethora of tools built into Corel Painter 2015, and they also have a great series of video tutorials published at YouTube. I am still working my way through these tutorials, but have learned a bit already.

I also appreciate that this software doesnt utilize a lot of system resources. I can run Corel Painter 2015 alongside other applications with no degradation in system performance. Of course, Corel provides options where you can set how much memory and other system resources are being devoted to Corel, which is a huge plus.

Like I said before, I am an amateur when it comes to graphic editing, but with Corel Painter 2015, I don't have to look like it. Sure, it may take me longer to perform some of the tasks than it would a graphic artist, but I can definitely get the job done with this software.",I've used this for years and loved it.............

I have to make clear here that I'm wholly an amateur when it comes to video editing (as anyone who has seen one of my YouTube videos could tell you), so all of the technical specs of software such as this are quite over my head.  The beauty of this product, though, is that it meets the needs of the newbie just wanting to edit his home movies as and offers up a huge buffet of options for advanced amateurs who know all of the acronyms, like to argue with other gurus about formats and resolutions, and produce darn-near professional quality videos for any and all occasions.  The software may initially look difficult to learn and use, but it doesn't take long to learn the basics - and then you can learn more advanced features at your own pace.

It goes without saying that you're going to need a pretty powerful computer if you want to use this software without tearing your hair out.  The system requirements are, in my opinion, something of a joke.  There's no way I would try running this with a mere 512 MB of RAM (or, in the case of Vista, even 1 GB); I would recommend at least 1 GB of RAM on Windows XP and 2 GB on Vista - anything less, and you're just asking for problems.  Memory becomes even more of an issue if you're going to be taking advantage of the wealth of HD capabilities this package boasts.  Those HD capabilities really are a big selling point, by the way (as you can tell just by a quick perusal of the box cover or product summary).  You certainly aren't going to be saving any HD videos to Blu-Ray using Windows Movie Maker.

The package comes with an impressive number of templates, filters, effects, etc., and the complete novice can rely on wizards to help him/her put together an impressive project.  Once you've mastered the basics, you have all kinds of enhancement options to choose from.  If you've thought about paying someone to put together a slideshow using old family pictures, forget about it.  It's easy to create a slideshow of images in VideoStudio, and you can basically control every aspect of the production, from inserting music to specifying the transformation settings from any one image to another.  It's almost as easy to create a video and truly customize it to your desires.  One particularly nice feature is the ability to add a voice track as well as a music track rather than limiting the user to one ""audio"" track.  You can also insert multiple overlays, which is another powerful feature.  And you can export your finished projects all sorts of ways: to your PC, to DVD, to online sites such as YouTube, and to iPods and a number of other portable devices.

VideoStudio isn't perfectly intuitive.  For example, you have a plethora of formats in which you can render a given file, but the rendering option is by no means prominent on the display.  I would also like to have seen some kind of cheat sheet for basic operations included alongside the manual, but I have to say this product manual itself isn't all that bad (although, as with most such software, your best source for information and guidance can probably be found in online forums and the like).  The manual is especially instructive in terms of setting things up and connecting to different digital and even analog video sources.

As far as the installation goes, I had no problems whatsoever (for the record, I'm running Vista with 4 GB of RAM).  Right off the bat, it came up saying I needed Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable SP1 Package and Microsoft DirectX Feb2006 Runtime, but the setup program installed those for me.  From then on, it was smooth sailing, including the extras that come on the bonus CD: WinDVD 8, MediaOne Plus Photo & Video Manager, and ULead Disc Image Recorder.

The bottom line in this: Ulead VideoStudio 11.5 Plus is, in my opinion, the best and most economical video editing program for amateurs on the market.  Even if you're only interested in making the most basic of videos for any purpose, I would definitely recommend that you take a look at this package.",I've used video editing software for years and loved it............. BUT.... the only thing I woud suggest is that it doesn't come with a link to the source code...........WOW..... my hair turned into

I am a former Peachtree user, so a lot of Sage 50's features are familiar.  I would personally be OK with the Pro version as I don't use many of the features of Premium, nor do I really need a 3-user license scheme.

One thing that would be nice to include with this is Payroll but this has to be added at an additional cost.
Note that built in support and product updates are only good for 365 days.

Overall - I don't like subscription schemes but I do think this is powerful and well-designed software.","I purchased Sage XL for the purpose of providing an accounting solution that is more than enough to meet the needs of today's growing enterprises. I used this for both desktop and mobile applications. Specifically, I used the Sage Web service"

Every September when they were updating the suite I would buy the next one. Typically for Norton, in the first months after the release, the software would suck because they were releasing it before it was ready.

Through the years, the software got worse and I started looking for alternatives and for a while I went with different packages.
As of this year I heard only good thing about the Norton Suites and I decided to try Norton 360. I also use Norton Internet Security which I like better. Norton 360 is a well rounded application suite which has extra features in addition to the Internet Security programs (firewall, antivirus, identity protection, etc). The most important additions are the Backup and the PC optimization. In my case I don't use the Backup part because it does not suit my needs but I can see that some people will use it and like it. Symantec offers the options of backing up online (2GB of space is free, for more than that you have pay), to an external HDD or to an optical drive. On the other side, I find the PC Optimization application almost useless. I did not see any difference in performance and that stopped me also from buying Norton System Works for my computers without 360 (System works includes the optimization tool).

Overall since the previous versions, they improved one important aspect of all the suites: SPEED! Before, installing Norton programs on your machine was like condemning the PC to a slow death, not you can barely notice the software is there.
Another complain I have is regarding the Antivirus part. At times, the antivirus is paranoid also reporting false positives. While this is not necessarily a bad thing (better safe than sorrow), it will not let you customize the action it takes. In the previous versions and on the enterprise editions (I use Symantec antivirus at work) it would allow you to change the way it behaves if it finds a threat (for ex. quarantine the file instead of deleting it). Now, the program will delete the file automatically without even asking. That is unacceptable in my book. The user should have the right to decide what to do. Norton Internet Security behaves the same way and I hate it.

Overall, it is a good suite for family PC(s). If you don't need the backup, save your money and go with the Internet Security suite instead of paying more for the 360!",I was a long-term user and the update suite was great. I didn't use any antivirus programs until I got this released. It's been an almost 3 year old and still looks like the perfect fit for my needs.

First a few specs on my computer system. I'm running Windows XP on a 2.5 GHz processor with 2.5 Gigs of memory. The tablet I use is a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wacom-Graphire-Steel-Blue-Tablet/dp/B00005U240/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wacom Graphire ""Steel-Blue"" Tablet</a>.

There are a couple of major improvements in Painter 11 over its predecessors:

- Tilt Recognition
If you have a tablet with pen-tilt detection, Painter 11 makes use of the tilt feature to broaden or narrow brush strokes with the tilt of the pen - narrower strokes with the pen perpendicular to the tablet and broader strokes with the pen at an angle to the tablet. (Alas, my Graphire series tablet is not tilt-aware and thus I'm unable to take advantage this feature.)

- Velocity Recognition
Painter 11 recognizes the velocity of a brush stroke and renders the stroke accordingly.

For a complete comparison of Painter 11 with previous versions, G00g1e for ""Painter_11_Family_Product_Matrix"" and follow the first link to view the PDF file.

I found Painter 11 very buggy and quirky. For example, I would get the following problems sporadically:

- Brush size lever refuses to budge
After I change the brush size beyond a certain threshold, I have a problem reducing it back down in size.

- Pasted layer shows up blank
After I copy and paste a layer, the pasted layer shows up blank.

- Custom Paper Library does not save
I'm unable to save a paper library that I've created and for the life of me, I can't figure out a way to make it save.

- Bush strokes don't show up
Periodically, brush strokes fail to show up. The only way I've found to fix this is to quit the application and start it back up.

These are just a few of the problems I can name off-hand. I doubt these are problems that are specific to my computer system because Painter support newsgroups are rife with accounts of people having similar problems. Some of these are a mild annoyance, but others are absolutely exasperating!

Painter requires lots of memory to run. The minimum requirement for memory on specs is 1 GB. I'd say 2GB or more would be ideal. Of course, it goes without say the faster processor you have, the better. Painter is VERY CPU-intensive.

As of now, I really wouldn't recommend Painter 11 until they've ironed out the bugs and quirks. If you really can't wait to try out the aforementioned new features, I suppose Painter 11 is usable; just be aware that it is not quite ready for prime time. Overall, I would rate Painter 11 3.5 Stars.",I was using this upgrade because it works great. It was nice to have it run on my system with no problems (except for the small number of times when I tried it). It works great for me because I don't have any

I used the USB cable that came in the box. I was moving from a Dell laptop with Windows XP installed to an Acer Aspire, with Windows XP and some other software already installed.  I was worried about duplications, so I deleted some software from the Acer before starting.  There's a long list of instructions to follow and the sequence is important.  They are presented twice: in the manual, and again on the screen as ysou go through the process.

I've tried them myself, and they provide an acceptable level of service- great news, considering the price. However, after a terrible experience with a well-known security product several years ago (see my other reviews for details), I swore off all security programs, deciding instead to be vigilant with my machines and my internet activities as a better way to protect my machines. Recently, though, I've tried several new products, and haven't had any major issues with any of them (though there have been some minor frustrations- see below). AVG Internet Security 2011 is the best I've seen, though, by far.

After test-driving Norton 360 on my 'junk' machine, and being frustrated with the way it tends to make decisions FOR the user, instead of giving the user options on how to handle potential threats, I was hoping to find a product that would be equally vigilant in detecting potential issues without taking the machine over. AVG Internet Security 2011 does just that. As you may know, some programs register 'false-positives' with security software- they are safe programs, but they exhibit some characteristics that trigger suspicion. That's fine- if my security software thinks there may be a threat, I want to know about it. However, some security software (like Norton) take the initiative of deleting or quarantining automatically, and this can be very frustrating. AVG engages the user at every juncture, presenting options to clean, delete, or make exemptions for such software. This is very helpful.

More generally, AVG runs silently, it doesn't use up a lot of resources, and its notification system is great- notices are displayed as corner pop-ups that don't distract, but are easy to review if desired. I never really had any issues before I got AVG, and haven't had any since, but it's great to know I'm protected without having to sacrifice performance or worry about the program doing something I don't want it to without my knowledge.

In brief, AVG Internet Security 2011 is a sound investment, and the fact that customer service is available makes it a worthwhile upgrade from the free versions. Highly recommended for anyone looking for effective, non-intrusive security for their PC.",I was really disappointed that Avalon discontinued this product because it's so new and improved. I was surprised that Avalon discontinued this product because it's so much faster and easier to manage. The price was right and the experience

Perhaps I should phrase it this way - Autodesk is a great addition to any artist's tool kit and it enhances Corel.  The one downside with this, and other programs, is that they should offer more instruction (say an 8-page booklet inside the CD case showing pictures of design in progress to highlight the tools available.)

And being that I'm on a Dr. Who kick of late...and for those who may be of like mind and enjoy graphic design...consider this program your sonic screwdriver and Corel as your Tardis.

Bess and George's Aunt Bet have chucked their life in Phoenix and bought Shadow Ranch. Now a phantom horse is appearing at night, heralding major accidents. Just before Nancy arrives, for example, Bess's uncle is bit by a rattlesnake and rushed to the hospital. What's going on here?

Suspects include cook Shorty Thurmond, store owner Mary Yazzie, and ranch hands Tex and Dave.

Fun fact - Mary Yazzie's character was named Mary Deer in the book. I don't know why they changed it.

By this point in the series, I was looking for something meatier than yet another tale of buried treasure and phantom animals.

The story is just too dang engaging to be ignored, though. Plus there are horses. Horses count for a lot in my book.

Puzzles: A -

Puzzles included everything from baking a cake to solving a little metal maze. The maze drove me insane.

One puzzle in particular made me roll my eyes because the way you find the solution is utterly dumb. You're looking for a really old piece of information, and Bess and George, stuck at the airport, happen to find a book that contains exactly what you need to know. And by old, I mean like a hundred years old. It was so contrived. Then again, I couldn't think of anything better, either.

Gameplay: A +

The new game interface features a wider screen and an inventory you have to open to access. I thought the wide screen was great but the extra clicking irritated me, because if you may miss the little button to close it or change pages. You get used to it, though.

Western life comes alive at Shadow Ranch, where you repair the chicken coop, perform daily tasks and always take care of your horse when you get back to the stable or Tex will have something to say to you!

Other fun in the game includes invesitgating a ghost town, learning to use a lariat (lasso) and completing a barrel race in under ten seconds.

You know how I said that DDI has everything but romance? Shadow Ranch has romance in spades. It's divine.

Time Changes: This one takes place in three days. When you complete the tasks for a certain day, it will automatically change to night.

Voice Acting: A

Raspy-voiced grump Tex sounds a lot like grumpy Red Knott from GDML (same voice actor) but it was nice to hear him again, like a phone call from an old friend. Many of the voice actors hear have appeared in other games, so it's a treat for a long-time fan. Superlative delivery, as always.

I am not an expert at movie editing. In fact, I have 50 or 60 hours of video that I have taken with my phone or GoPro but have not put together for sharing with others. Part of the problem has been the rather rudimentary editing programs that have been dispensed with cameras or computers that I have purchased. Movie Edit Pro is both fuller featured than the afterthought programs and more intuitive. Even though it was a completely new program to me I was able to make a DVD full of videos of my dog complete with navigation. There are a lot more feature that I haven't begun to explore. There is an online manual that you can download that is nearly 400 pages long, which hints at just how much there is to learn before you have mastered this.

The one thing I would like to change is the installation options. This package came with only the option to install via a DVD player. I do not, however, own an external DVD player, so I have no way to get this onto my laptop, which is the computer that I use most of the time. I will probably get an external DVD drive in the near future, but it is frustrating not to have options. Movie Edit Pro is hardly the only software developer that limits you to only one installation option. Companies make it possible for the user to install the program on more than one computer, but that assumes that every computer has the same capabilities as every other. I would really like to master this program, but that is not going to happen so long as I have to do all of my editing on the computer I use less than the others.","I was using this program because it's my favorite, ever.

MS Office 2013 and its component parts are not compatible with Windows XP or Vista. Windows 7 or Windows 8 are required for you to install this program.

While MS Publisher does have its quirks and limitations, I have used the 2010 version successfully for a couple of years to publish four-color newsletters and bulletins.

One of the advantages of Publisher was that it allowed you to print as a composite CMYK document which could then be sent to a print shop for four-color printing.

With version 2013 this feature has been removed and printing houses can no longer use a direct MS Publisher file for printing. There seems to be no workaround for this problem.

In addition to removing this feature and the HTML feature another reviewer commented on, the program is more of a pain to use than before. Just like other Microsoft ""improvements"" this program requires more steps to do everything than in previous editions. They have also failed to fix previous shortcomings, such as the ability to create keyboard macros.

All in all, ""new and improved"" is neither with this product. If you have an older version of Publisher that continues to work with whatever operating system you are using I encourage you to continue using it. If you have to upgrade, find a copy of Publisher 2010 (which is compatible with Windows 8) and leave this dog in the doghouse.",I was using this component because it's just too heavy to use on a single computer.

Gorgeous graphics, a unique interface, beautiful easy-on-the eyes bible pages, and so much more it's overwhelming. You can go from casual reading to in-depth historical research with a few clicks. There's so much to GLO...I'm still discovering stuff about it.

GLO at its base offers the bible in five versions, an atlas, a timeline, topical, media, and a place for your stuff. Reading the bible on GLO is a joy. The pages are laid out beautifully - like a book displayed on a screen. Makes it easy to read. In the bottom you can view commentaries or add your own notes. You can also see notes that other have made via YouVersion. (Nice feature!) Also, it will display any media (video, pics, and more) that may be relevant to the part of the bible you're reading. If you right-click on bible passages, another sub-menu appears to copy it or take your study further.

GLO's gorgeous screens reminds me Linux Ubuntu's darkly colorful Unity interface mixed with Apple's love of icons all in a unique interface package. Icons glow and grow, screens slide, all on a black background - except for when you're reading the bible. Your work sessions are recorded as icons you can return to. The different parts of the menu and program options are accessed on sliding tabs and icons. This is not a flat bible program - it's a 3D bible world that you are navigating through. Is visually exciting, but the possibility to get lost or wander is too easy as well.

Be forwarned: you do need a very capable computer with a good amount of processing power. GLO is graphically intensive. Icons glow and fade, the background shifts, something is always moving making it visually exciting. However, I don't doubt this will tax some older computers graphics capabilities. Make sure you have the minimum requirements (hopefully more) so you can enjoy this program for how it is created.

The one thing that annoys me to pieces is that I really don't know how to process all this information. I have a fully loaded and gorgeous program and no skills to how to use it to my benefit. I wish GLO had included a follow-along tutorial explaining all the different features, how they work together, and the different ways I can benefit from it. I did see a short video trailer about GLO and it just affirmed that there's so much that can be done with this program that I haven't conceived yet.

I'm also disappointed that there isn't a Strong's concordance or similar (or at least I haven't found it yet) to do word research on the Greek or Hebrew meaning. That's so automatic with so many other bible programs it's surprising not to find it with this one.

GLO is quite frankly mind-boggling! It offers so much that you are pretty much blown away. It offers a stunningly beautiful interface and a tons of information and resources to draw from. It also offers the ability to link your information to an iPhone/iPad app so you can carry it around with you. The only drawback is that you do need a rather powerful computer to get the most out of it without lag or frustration. I also believe a tutorial is would have been sorely helpful so you get the most bang for you buck rather than just wandering around.","I found this useful and useful for anyone who wants to read & understand the software. The interface is nice, too. I tried it out for myself and found very useful things. I did extensive research on the subject and loved it. The"

It's a great puzzle game that starts with a gob of goo. You play through a campaign of sorts with multiple levels (and in a couple of cases multiple paths to follow). Each level has the same basic challenge: get as many gobs of goo into a faucet drain on the other side/end of the play area. There's a minimum number you're targeting with anything over that minimum giving you a bonus. Also, any additional gobs you ""rescue"" go into a sort of bank. This bank is really just a sandbox area where the goal is to build the highest structure you can build with your result compared against other players across the world. Pretty cool.

The main gameplay mechanic is to use a gob to create a segment of a structure. Depending on the proximity of a gob to another already placed gob, you'll get one or more connections to the new gob you're placing. Think of it like you're playing with some sort of spider silk goo. Once you place the goo ball, those strands of connecting goo become solid (well, as solid as rubber). As you build your structure, gravity and other factors (some maps have wind or moving objects) come into play. There are also things that go bump in the night or are sharp and can make a map even more challenging. Once you've gotten your structure close enough to the faucet, the surviving goo balls will make their way in and you're done.

Over the different levels, you'll be introduced to different types of goo (for example, there are goo balls that act like balloons and others that can be reused after you've set them and my favorite are the ones that ignite when lit up) and some unique challenges like using balloons to float a structure over a chasm and using physics to lob a structure to another point. It rarely become repetitive.

All in all, it's a well thought out and well engineered game that is fun and quirky. It can also get addictive as you figure out new ways to structure your goo. If you like puzzle games, you'll definitely want to grab this game and the price is great for it. There's a lot of gameplay in here (something like 4 or 5 sections with 10+ levels each) and for some maps you'll want to try them again and again to get them just right or to eek out a few more gobs for your tower in the sandbox.","I like how fast the drains get in the water, how many enemies can you find? I'm a big goo here and I'm almost certain there are some who can kill me because I'm a big go"

It took about 10 minutes to install and an extra 2 to update.  Seriously, this software is very easy to use and install.  After installation, this software was ready to use and the interface is easy to navigate.  It reads files FAST.  The only slow up is when you activate the parental controls (a handy feature to have for a family) so if you don't need it, I suggest skipping it.  I have no complaints about the software at all!

The customer service on the other hand, I am not so happy with them.  I have difficulty getting an e-mail response despite several attempts.  Although it is a very minor issue, it would be nice to get a response.  I cannot find a telephone number anywhere so that just leaves e-mail.  Hmmmm.

I've been using it now as my primary e-mail client for about three months. So far, so good.

I had little to no problems installing Outlook 2007. I'm using XP, and my Office suite is 2000. I like the GUI, but not all documents (especially Word and HTML docs) render as they do in their native apps, and I'm assuming this is because my other Office apps are getting way old.

Also, I appreciate that Outlook 2007 lets you add RSS feeds. I subscribe to many newsletter and blog reports and find this feature useful. I've had no problems with just the e-mail reading/organizing capabilities; everything there works just fine.

Like many people writing reviews here, I'm disappointed that Outlook 2007 with BCM is so slow. I used to use Outlook Express as my e-mail client, which is pretty fast compared to Outlook 2007, so maybe it's just a matter of getting used to the new app.

I was hoping this app would allow me to do more with billing and invoicing, but I've read a few blogs and discovered to get Business Contact Manager to really do all it can do (which is probably a lot), you'll need Microsoft Accounting installed, too. I'm considering buying that app, but I wish I didn't have to.

The full functionality of the app is a bit beyond me at this point (again, I'm upgrading from Outlook Express, so the learning curve is no surprise), but I hope this changes with time. Right now, I find myself using the same three or four functions all the time, which is normal. It's how I generally use the other apps in the Office group.

I've found myself in the past criticizing certain aspects of other Microsoft products (Word in particular), only to find out later these apps had the ability to do what I wanted them to do all along, but I just didn't know it. In general, I wish Microsoft's apps were a bit more intuitive.","I've used this for many years and I've always found that the client service is great.

The effects for photos and video are what you would use to just add a little something - you can add sparkle effects to part of a movie or tint it like aged film, or put a filter on a photo to make it look different.  None of the effects are highly controlled.  This won't take you to a professional level of total control.  Instead this will give you an expanded toolbox over what already comes with Windows.  Instead of Paint, you can do a bit more, and instead of Movie Maker, you can do a bit more, and instead of clicking and dragging files to a CD for burning, you can do a bit more.  A bit more in so many areas gives a nice low cost tool box for home use.  That low cost is because almost any high end professional software is going to charge more for each type of software - video, photo editing, etc - than this whole package costs.

The tutorials that Roxio puts out on how to use the software match this use.  The tutorials will have tips about how to take good clips for movies.  For example, they tell you to try to film a little before the thing you want to capture and then to hold the camera steady and keep filming for a few seconds after it's over.  This gives you extra footage to use for transitions and to prevent you just cutting off abruptly.  Good tips like that, which have nothing to do with the software, are mixed with instructions on how to use the software.  This could be really good if you want to start doing multimedia, but haven't done much before.  The instructions that come with this software are about the process of making good movies and pics, as well as how to use software.  You can come in with no knowledge and get good simple instructions.

The software is also built around the basic home uses of sharing video and pics,  it even has a share online button in the video editor to upload to YouTube.  Planning for social media is important, because sometimes software will want to save in formats that are harder to share.  This software is fast and simple for your basic home uses,

The best person for this is someone who is already taking and sharing pics and videos, and just wants a quick way to boost how you can prep those files.  If you've used an Instagram filter to finalize a pic before you share it, or wanted to add some transition effects in a movie to give it a little more polish but do not want to spend a long time reaching perfection and nailing down details, then this software would be a good fit for you. In this case, the price difference for the Family version (this one) and the ""Professional"" version is very small.  So, look at the chart of features on Roxio's webpage to consider getting the pro version.  The most useful feature it adds is automatic audio clean up tools in videos, but also it has extra special effects for movies and a different tool for photo editing with more features.","I think it is a bit flimsy, but this one is a bit tricky since I'm putting on a video with my hair as I finish it off.

Based on last year's software, the IRS estimate feature for predicting the next year's taxes (2014 for me) and estimated payments was very poor. To solve my problem, I paid extra for their accounting service (which I believe is included in this year's special) and it was excellent. They suggested that I just modify information in my 2013 TT file after submission, and use that to more accurately get an idea of the estimate for the following year, given there will be changes in the tax codes. Otherwise, while the software was somewhat confusing, especially if you have to continue on another day, it did work for me in 2013 and in prior years. Also, in contrast to prior years, in 2013 it took forever to be connected to a person for free assistance. The community help feature was worthless. The paid tax expert accountant that I used in 2013 was much much better than the free help, and was also familiar with the software.","I was using this process for several years and found that the software would better accommodate my needs.

The map program itself, which is Microsofts Streets and Trips, is not nearly as good.  After using it for a little while I find myself going back to Google or my garmin software.  I have the USB gps to go with this, but even still the tracking is haphazard, and it takes a surprisingly long time for my laptop to recognize the gps.  I've increasingly come to the conclusion that this side of this program needs a major overhaul, and would have been really competitive in 2002, but not so much now.

The fact that it does have Metro and does NOT have a start menu, keeps me from giving it 3 stars.  To get the same functionality, I have to install third party software and re-purchase DVD functionality and Media Center, which I already had before...and used.  In desktop mode (funny because it's a desktop anyway), the interface is a lot smoother.  I've noticed that they made some real improvements with network connectivity on the Xbox 360.  Whenever I wanted to listen to music from my Xbox to my home stereo using Win 7, it would only connect about half the time, making it unreliable.  With Windows 8, the connection is virtually 100%.  Of course, Microsoft overdid it and, my xbox imports all my file folders too, which gives me a big mess of empty folders it can't read.  With all the sophistication of the Xbox, you still rely on folders...really?

Regarding the Metro interface, it's a good tablet OS, but why on earth would you bolt a tablet interface to an OS designed for a desktop??  It's just plain stupid!  Oh yeah, take away the start button...and menu, then put settings and folders in places where no one can find them unless they navigate through a tablet interface with their mouse and keyboard.  Fortunately, there are third party programs like ""Classic Shell"" that adds a start menu and boots straight to the desktop.  For most people, they would be wondering if this is some kind of Halloween prank.

When I have software like DVD playback working, then take it away when I pay for an upgrade, then make me purchase it again as an add-on feature, it's not much of an upgrade, is it?  In fact, that's a downgrade that I just paid for!

Another issue is UEFI.  Basically, Microsoft takes control of your bootloader with the installation of Windows.  This had nothing to do with security.  It was Microsoft's way of locking-out Linux by encrypting the bootloader to anything except Windows 8.  Ethics will always be in debate.  Apple does the exact same thing, but at least it locks the computer into good software.  Apple also designs the hardware, so it has an interest in protecting hardware integrety.  Microsoft is a software vendor, so they do not design any of the hardware it runs on, so the only other reason would be to lock out another OS.

As a desktop, it's surprisingly stable.  It has all the good qualities of Win 7 with better connectivity and plug & play support.  Unfortunately it doesn't have much more than that because Microsoft spent so much time and money on Metro.  Security is as poor as ever, so I rely on Norton.  All in all, had it not been for the fact I can get this version for free from my university, I never would have upgraded.  For most people, it's not an upgrade.","I like that Interface has no built-in security issue. I was able to use it without downgrade, so I decided to try it now and after I got online I ran a demo of the newer Windows 7 operating system"

Since I ran out of Office 2003 licenses and never liked Office 2007, I decided to use Works 9.0 for a while, knowing it was nothing like Office 2003.  For basic tasks -- appointments, word processing (as long as you're not trying to write a book), spreadsheets (as long as you don't need multiple worksheets or complicated formulas), and very simple database tasks -- it works surprisingly well, and the interface is very easy to learn.  What also surprised me was how fast and stable the program is.  I now simply leave it open all the time.  I like the project-based approach, whereby you pick a project theme that came with the software.

Of course, if you need serious office-suite features, nothing can beat the real Office, which is not that more expensive for the Home and Student edition.

Pros: The Rosetta Stone approach to language learning is a new (and quite frankly, effective) one. Instead of learning vocabulary and grammar through repetitious rote memorization, Rosetta Stone utilizes the user's own deductive logic and inherent learning abilities to make the language fun and much easier to master. Each unit begins with the introduction of new sounds and words. You aren't expected to know what the words mean at this point, but you are encouraged to repeat them and listen to how you sound compared to native speakers. This is accomplished by using the included headset and microphone in conjunction with visual feedback of your voice.
Next comes the vocabulary section. As I mentioned before, you are not given direct translations of the words; instead, you are shown a series of pictures that help you deduce the meanings of words and how they fit into the structure of the sentence. It becomes a sort of detective game, as you are given a sentence written entirely in the language, and using your brain, you come to instinctively pull it apart to find the meaning. After you find meaning to your words, the Phrases and Speaking sections help you put it into practice and solidify everything you learned in the unit. Add to that the included CDs full of audio lessons and samples of native speech, and you have a full package that turns an incredible task into an enjoyable experience.
Cons: The only real con I could find with the software itself was the price. It may seem like a large price to pay for some CD-ROMS and a USB headset, but after using the product for awhile, I have come to see its true value. I have taken nearly a year and a half of college-grade Japanese, and I still have learned a great deal from the software. Also, the presentation of the material makes it fun enough for leisurely learners and youths.  So even though the price tag is a bit exorbitant, it beats the heck out of paying for 2 years of college language courses!
Intended Users: This is where Rosetta Stone courses really shine. Not only did I have a go at the program, but I set up user profiles for my mother, father, sister and nephew in order to get a good cross-sectional view of how different ages and educations would react. All were positive. Perhaps the greatest surprise to me was my father, who is a very stern ""you can't teach an old dog new tricks"" kind of guy found himself getting caught up learning a language that he didn't even have a need for! All in all, I'd certainly suggest this program to anyone looking to learn another language, brush up on one that may be slipping away due to lack of practice, or just looking to stretch their mind a bit.","I took a different approach to learning about and using the language.

And while I find Dramatica has some good points, I find that there are some parts of this application that are just clunky. Number 1. The character creation screens and data is just terrible. For an application of this price I would expect a little more thorough approach. I would rally like an opportunity to compile a character's background, history and personal info within the application. I'd also like to be able to flag some of these traits so that they can be added to the story or become part of subplots used in the story. For instance if a character is insecure, I'd like to add that as an emotional goal to overcome during the length of the story. I'd also like to export characters easily for use in subsequent stories. This is not easily done.  In my opinion, the entire Character generation screen is useless. (I won't even go there about the UGLY selection of character portraits). Come on, for this price get some nice looking professional icons rather than those ugly clip-art ones, OR make it easier to ad your own portraits.. Have you tried importing a portrait? Its not easy let me tell you!  When trying to chose an icon to represent my protagonist I had a choice between X-Men and small cheap looking pictures of ugly cartoons. Come on now.

On to the software, I like the storyforming tools. But really the terminology at points is obscure. When it says my main character's ""thematic opposite to the area of John's greatest sensitivity concerns willingness to reevaluate"" it would be nice if I didn't have to refer to the manual to figure out what that means.  I'm not a dummy, but I would like to be able to use the software without having to refer to the HELP.

Overall, I LIKE Dramatica Pro. But its by no means an easy App to work with. Some parts seem to be deliberately obscure, and its thin on character creation and rather heavy on your wallet.",I am a huge user of Apisoft and I'm amazed at the number of unique characters that appear in it.

The box contains the scanner itself, a USB to mini USB cable and a cardboard folder holding calibration paper, cleaning paper, a single use wet cleaning pad, a soft carry pouch and the software CD.

The scanner itself is amazingly small and draws its power from the USB connection, so it doesn't require a power brick and desk clutter is reduced to an absolute minimum. You probably won't find a scanner with a smaller footprint, and you won't think twice about slipping it into your suitcase when going on business trips, so you can get a headstart on filing your expense reports (if you plan on traveling with the NeatScan, consider purchasing the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Travel-Case/dp/B000KBFX6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Travel Case</a>).

The software installs in a couple of minutes; it adds a NeatScan toolbar to Microsoft Office applications, from which you can control scanning. Configuration could not be simpler, and after a quick run of the calibration sheet you're ready to go. When scanning to Excel, you can use ""Neat Sheets"", templates allowing the software to know how to locate and assign information (this is geared towards filling up expense reports, but can be customized easily to perform a variety of tasks). When scanning to Word, OCR is performed automatically and results in an editable text document.

Scanning a letter-size page takes around 10 seconds. OCR processing can take about a minute on a complex page. The scanner is capable of passable color results with photographs, but it's clearly not its strongest point. The two buttons on top (Scan and PDF) trigger a scan (or scan to PDF) into the currently active Microsoft Office application (if available).

If you wish to upgrade to the full version of the NeatReceipts software, or if you're switching to a Macintosh, you can purchase the corresponding software directly from the company's web site (neatco dot com), and use it with this scanner.

This product is amazingly easy to use, and the Neat Company has quite a knack for crafting excellent software. If you need a scanner mainly for document archival and expense reports, it just can't be beat for the price. If you have lots of documents to scan, consider the more expensive NeatDesk scanner which is faster, easier to feed and supports duplex scanning.","I was excited to get this product because the price was right and the data was easy to obtain.

I am impressed with the consistency of the software's interface, and the consolidation improvements that have been implemented throughout the product. The updated online support makes it both easy and convenient to explore new and existing features, and get the most out of everything Sage 50 has to offer.

Sage 50 is still my favorite accounting software. The customizable Business Status page smoothly maximizes screen real estate based on the selections that have been made, its accessibility to the modifications are hassle-free, making it both simple and easy to hide or show information as I prefer. I love the look of Sage's Business Status overview.

The organization of the accounting features are well placed, and the drill-down hierarchy is intuitively structured. This most recent update includes new quote lists, which provide a single view of open quotes with their statuses. Invoicing offers improved billing information and is enhanced by credit notifications for customers to which they apply. Payment receipts now link to associated open invoices in one place so they may be applied accordingly. Accounts payable information is accessible from one screen for easy reporting. Overall, these few new features are a welcome effort form Sage.

I never feel lost within the Sage 50 interface. Information interacts so much better than ever before within the software, and I am completely happy with the performance. The software and its data loads quickly, everything is easy to find and the rich feature set is a pleasure to utilize.

Yes I had to use Word at school and I had to use Word at work.

But there is something about WordPerfect that draws me to it.  Admittedly the first computer I ever had came with WordPerfect and that is really what I learned to type on, but it is more then that.

The thing I find is that while WordPerfect and the other suite programs take a little bit more time to learn and understand, once you get the basic ideas ow how things are laid out, it is so much easier to to use WordPerfect, Quattro and Presentations.

Getting to the functions you want is easier, and more intuitive.  I don't find myself hunting through menus and boxes to find the changes I want to make.

Also the help functions are soooo much better.  When you do a help search on Microsoft, you basically get a web search for whatever words you entered, with WordPerfect you get actual useful answers and tutorials on how to do what you are trying to do.

Also with WordPerfect you have the option to save files directly to PDF (A Must have nowadays if you ask me) and you have a program called paperport that lets you scan in papers and convert them, a really nice program.

While I am still forced to do much of my work on Word, I find myself more and more using WordPerfect saving and then just converting the files to MS Word or excel.  A little extra work, but still easier then using the Microsoft products.

I wholeheartedly approve of this office suite.

So, I gotta be honest.  I thought the concept was brilliant by Microsoft to come up with a fusion product that merges the world of touch traditional.  However, it is so poorly executed and provides such a jarring user experience at times that I just can't give it a high rating.  I'm afraid that I am just hoping for Microsoft to release some updates that allow you to force it into one mode or another. I'm forcing myself to keep Windows 8 to become proficient, and I'm resisting the urge to install one of the ""classic"" start button programs to make desktop mode feel like Windows 7, but it really is tempting.

I think Microsoft is onto something, but it just isn't right, yet.","I'm trying to use this on my phone. I had never ever used a phone before. So I gave it to my mom who wanted me to send an email to her mother who said ""no thanks, but I can'"

It turns out that Ultimate is considerably better than Corel VideoStudio Pro X9. DON'T buy this version if the prices are the same. I don't know why they are both currently being sold for $79.99, or how long this situation will last, but I would be hacked if I paid ~$80 for this version and found that I could have purchased the same product with the ability to add more camera views and with a LOT of extra high quality editing tools included.

Moving on the the actual performance of this product. It is what I have been using to edit video since I can remember. We had VideoStudio X5 on our computer and upgraded from it. We have used many different versions over time. They haven't really changed all that much, which is to say that they are all pretty straightforward and easy to use - especially once you learn your way around the program and have invested some time in using the program.

It is very easy to add basic graphics, text overlays, and the usual stuff. Music is easily added and you can even toss a video in and let it make the video for you and it will often be good enough, or need only a little final editing. Which is pretty amazing, but most of the software out there does this too.

I find it very easy to use, and Corel has gotten much better recently when it comes to customer service. Something changed there... They also have some very good user-to-user resources if you google them and ask questions. Often fellow users would have answers before Corel.  But as I said, Corel has improved a lot lately.

There are some cons, almost but not quite knocking this down to four stars.

Occasionally, I have run into glitchy and stuttery operation. This usually happens when loading a video format that is older or natively designed so that it uses more processor power than other, more modern codecs.

/UPDATE:  After playing with version X9 some more, I am finding that it does load some of these files without having to use a conversion program first - that is a really big deal if you have any of these old cameras around, or need to work with video from these cameras.  This finding makes me rate the software a solid 5 stars! END UPDATE/ Second, I really expect that I should be able to load ANY video file that my computer can PLAY into this program and edit it, and have it convert quickly to something that is modern and easy to edit and use. But I've had to jump through hoops to use older codecs like Kodak Zi8 and Creative VADO sometimes.  I understand that part of the problem lies with the older cameras. But I really think this software should be mature enough now to make those things invisible.  We should be past the days of someone wanting to edit some video they found laying around on their old camera and having to research how to convert that video. If the computer can play it (it can) then this software (IMHO) should edit it.

Overall, I am a big fan of Corel. I have been using Paint Shop Pro since the days when it was shareware and JASC. When Corel took over the software, there were some hiccups, but they have done a lot of good things with it and that software, in my opinion, is every bit as good as Photoshop for most people and priced much more reasonably. I feel like VideoStudio is sort of the same deal with video editing software. A FAIRLY priced product that works really well for most people without having to take classes at their community college just to use it.

Overall, I highly recommend this software and in spite of its minor issues, it is a great way to edit just about any type of video. I will say, despite the ""Pro"" label, it is not pro software. It is really good home software, but if you are a pro you know that and are using specialized tools on specialized hardware. This is great for almost everyone else though.","I was first introduced to this product in Madera in the early 90's and for some years had them ship me the product until I found the correct version.

Since the 2003 version I have noticed a significant slowing of my computing but have been unable to identify the source.

I ran four different anti-spyware programs, I ""cleansed"" the system using all of Norton's utilities and still my computer was painfully slow hanging up on startup and shutdown. I even ran Hijack This and scrupulously followed the tutorial on MajorGeeks. My problems grew progressively worse until I read somewhere that Norton might well be causing my problems.

At first I discounted this possibility out of hand - I mean, after all, this was a premier program that had been around for years! Their new CEO is touted as the second coming by all of the business magazines and newspapers. Surely, IT couldn't be the source of my problems. But out of frustration I took Norton off of my computer and VOIL my problems went away! I couldn't believe it. No more computer crashes, no more slovenly performance, no more hanging up on shutdown and interminable startup times.

I was then confronted with finding another program to supplant Norton. I searched Cnet and came up with PC-Cillin! This program works great. I does not degrade performance one iota! No hanging up on shutdown or interminable startup times. This program works silently in the background and is literally updated daily in 3 - 5 seconds. I couldn't possibly be more pleased.

The firewall in this program seems to work OK - I am unable to appreciate a significant difference from my free version of Zone Alarm.  Spam control implementation is very clumsy, as are most other programs, and it would seem it will be awhile until we get a seamless elegant spam control solution, at least from Trend Micro.  Spyware is certainly no better than Ad-aware.

For the life of me I cannot understand how a company as distinguished as Symantec could fritter away all their goodwill and reputation by putting out a program that is quite simply awful.  I'm glad to be saying goodbye to Norton and its memory and system resource busting program.

At the end of the day the cornerstone of any security suite is going to be the anti-virus program.  PC Cillin's anti-virus program is second to none.  The rest of the suite is good, but not necessarily the best and the free programs from Zone Alarm and Ad-Aware are, IMO, better.  My recommendation, go with the PC Cillin anti-virus program and forget the suite.

Do yourself a favor. Forget Norton and McAffee. PC-Cillin anti-virus is incomparably better.

I have always been a Photoshop guy.  I am a pro photographer, and I have taught photoshop in my college photography classes for years.  However, the latest versions aren't really being sold.  Instead you pay a monthly or yearly fee.  No thanks.  I know that's the trend lately, but I don't have to like it.  As a result I am in the process of switching.  The Corel suite is, so far, just as powerful.  By that I mean that I haven't yet wanted to do something and not been able to do it with this software.  There has certainly a learning curve.  Corel uses different terms than Adobe.  What I know as layers are now called objects, to give just one example.  It took me a while to become an expert at Photoshop, and this software will be no different.

As primarily a photographer, Photo-Paint will be the portion of the suite I use most.  It has been easy to adjust so far, and there are hints both at the right side and bottom of the screen.  I already like some things better.  For instance, when cloning, which I use often, in this program you select the area to clone from by simply right clicking it.  I was used to having to press alt, but this way is easier -- no hands on the keyboard.  I have so far found this to be quite easy to figure out on my own or with the on-screen hints.  I have only used Help when I didn't know what to call something because the terminology is different.

The Website Creator is also easy to use and has some good, pre-made templates.  I don't do a lot of websites, but I did a quick one to try it out and it was pretty easy.  In this case I am comparing it to Site Spinner, and this seems to compare well.  Aftershot allows editing of RAW files, and many other functions I have been using Lightroom to do.

The suite comes with a lot of extras, such as 1000 fonts, 10,000 pieces of clipart, templates, frames, fills, and a bunch more, and all can be used royalty free if you are doing commercial work.  The suite works well on my Windows 10 computer, and handles my dual monitor setup well.  I am impressed so far, and it isn't too expensive for a complete suite of graphics tools.  I am making the switch.","I'm a total amateur photographer, and this is the only photoshop that I've ever used. I have a hugely different background and I'm almost certain you'll find it useful.

They often try to do too much -- probably to convince you that they're more valuable than the freebies -- and wind up eating all your CPU cycles and bringing your computer to its knees. In fact, that was my initial experience with McAfee 2016 Total Protection on my Windows 10 x64 laptop. McAfee was consistently eating 18%-25% of my CPU, and I'm this wasn't during a periodic in-depth scan and it even persisted when I turned off ""real time protection.""

I contacted tech support for help. McAfee technical support is available 24 hours/day, which is nice, but it also enormously confusing, which is not. McAfee's web sites are poorly organized, often leading you around in circles as you try to figure out which link is the right one to follow. Part of the problem is that McAfee has recently been acquired by Intel, and they're still trying to get all their stuff integrated. Another problem is that almost none of the materials on their web site refers to Total Protection, which is either so new they haven't gotten around to documenting it yet, or it's already been discontinued, so they're never going to get around to documenting it. Skipping over the painful process of actually requesting service, I got a  pleasant woman from the Philippines on the line (good English; no complaints) who poked around my computer using LogMeIn and concluded that there was nothing wrong. She informed me that if McAfee is taking up 15% to 20% of CPU ALL THE TIME !!!! that's normal.

If that was normal, I would have removed it already. Fortunately, something she did, something I did, something in the most recent update, and/or something that Microsoft did with its most recent Windows 10 update (the most likely answer, I think) substantially resolved the problem, so, at this particular moment McAfee is using between 0.5% and 1.0% of CPU. Note that Real Time Protection may use a lot of CPU while you're doing backups, because it's checking each file as it's opened. This means that just at the time your computer is most loaded down, it will be even more loaded down ... which is OK as long as it happens while you're sleeping.

As for the Android portion of Total Protection. I (a) can't figure out what it is or what it does, and (b) can't figure out how to get it for my Amazon Fire Phone, which does not (without some minor hacking) have access to the Google Play store, the default repository for all Android apps. (Not McAfee's fault, of course.) There is no documentation available (as far as I can tell) about Total Protection for Android or iOS on the McAfee web site, which doesn't help. I tried getting support tonight, but their wait times at 10pm MST were so long that the chat program timed out on me three times and I wasn't able to  get someone on the phone before I had to take another call. So ... ?

Bottom line: If the current $29 price holds up, this is reasonable quality commercial computer protection for all the computers in your household. (I say ""reasonable quality"" because it's protection is rated as at least good by the independent evaluators, but it doesn't typically get top scores.) Support leaves something to be desired, but at least it's 24 hour support, and you should be able to get someone on the phone if you can wait a while. It's hard to tell if this product is just ramping up or is on its way out.","I have been using Antivirus software since it launched, back several months ago.

I installed it on computers with both Microsoft XP and Vista Home Premium operating systems.  I previously had Norton Internet Security installed on both, so I thought it was just an upgrade.  For this reason I gave the program 4 stars.  Now I'm not sure.

After two months the XP operating system ran without any problems either on Visa or XP.  But then the new computer running on Vista crashed.  I lost all my files and had to access the recovery portion of the hard drive to get the computer to boot.  Then I had to download all the security downloads.  I have only dial-up so this has taken many hours.  And I have to reinstall all the programs I use - and delete the junk programs that came with the HP computer.  What a mess, and what a lot of work. Even the backup disk, created with Norton 360 didn't work as I hoped.  I do have all the files on the disk, but they did not all reload after I fixed the crash.

Update 3/1/09:  Maybe the problem was with the operating system, Vista Home Premium; or maybe it was Norton 360.  And maybe the glitch was repaired with a later update I download.  Anyway, the problem hasn't manifested itself since I reinstalled everything. Furthermore, I must admit, the problem never did occur with the WinXP operating system.  Also, it should be noted that the program I'm using has been updated with a new version.

Update 6/7/09:  I have continued to use Norton 360, Ver. 2.0, for another three months with Vista and WinXP and have had no new problems.

You can do almost everything that you can with Microsoft Office 2003 and most things that you can do with Microsoft Office 2007/2010, as well as some things that you can't do with Microsoft Office. It includes PDF file handling/editing/scanning features, web publishing capabilities, and special tools for legal professionals and the government. However, it lacks some functionality included with Microsoft Office, for example, the ability write formulas, and Microsoft Excel has more advanced formula handling than Quattro Pro X5, etc. Therefore you can say that Word Perfect X5 is aimed more towards business offices and less towards home, academia and engineering.

Word Perfect X5 costs less than the Microsoft Office business version, which is one of the reasons that I am saying that Word Perfect X5 is an interesting alternative to Microsoft Office. I should mention that if you use Microsoft Office for a business or non-profit organization you cannot use Microsoft Office Home and Student (which would be cheaper). I can add that Word Perfect X5 is supposedly compatible with Microsoft Office. However, even though you can open Microsoft Office files using Word Perfect X5, not all Microsoft Office features are supported, so you may lose some stuff if you convert.

WordPerfect X5 is a word editor, with the capability to open and save to a large variety of file formats including WordPerfect formats and all Microsoft Word formats (.doc, .docx, etc), PDF, RTF, html, and much more. When you start WordPerfect X5 you can choose from four kinds of editor interfaces; Word Perfect Mode, WordPerfect Classic Mode, WordPerfect Legal Mode, and Microsoft Word Mode. If you choose Microsoft Word mode you get an interface, which looks more like that of Microsoft Word 2003 than Microsoft Word 2007/2010. I was impressed by the PDF editing/handling capabilities of WordPerfect X5 as well as the fact that saving to web formats (.html) result in leaner and less awkward files than when you do the same thing with Microsoft Word. As mentioned I missed the formula editing capabilities. One interesting special feature is that you can save your document without the metadata (security purposes). Metadata is all the other information stored in your document that is not directly related to the display of your document, for example, the edit history, creation date, creator, etc. Unfortunately I've noticed that WordPerfect X5 have some minor stability issues (occasional crashes).

Quattro Pro X5 is a spreadsheet application similar to Excel in Microsoft Office and it features both a Quattro Pro mode, Lotus 1-2-3 mode, and an Excel mode. At work we used Excel extensively to collect large amounts of data that was used in fairly complex formulas and displayed on multiple graphs on multiple spreadsheets. When I imported these Excel 2003 files into Quattro Pro X5 a lot of stuff was lost. On the other hand you can do almost everything you can do with Excel with Quattro Pro X5. I liked the fact that Quattro Pro X5 does not have a 64,000 row-limit like Excel.

Presentations X5 is similar to Power Point in Microsoft Office, and like WordPerfect X5 it offers more than one display mode, a Presentations mode and a Power Point mode. Even though the Power Point mode looks similar to Microsoft Power Point interface they are not identical. It also features additional, or rather more accessible, controls for making slide shows and creating animations. It is also very easy to insert movies into your WordPerfect X5 presentations. The WordPerfect Expert can help you create interesting web pages based on your Presentations X5 slide shows. I liked the fact that the slides were listed on a horizontal bar at the bottom. It made navigation easier. It general I liked Presentations X5 a little bit better than Power Point and except for some fonts I could import all my Power Point presentations to Presentations X5.

Word Perfect Office X5 also came with various tools like Word Perfect Lightning, Paperport, an XML based project designer, an email client and a scheduling application called Mozilla Thunderbird, and the so called Pleading Expert that helps legal professionals create custom pleading styles, etc. Some of these tools you had to install separately. I played around with Paperport and found it to be a fun tool, but perhaps marginally useful. Whether you find these tools useful or not I think depends on your situation.

In summary I recommend Word Perfect Office X5 to some people, those who will use it for an office and do not need formulas or very advanced spreadsheet calculations. If you already have everything in Microsoft Office formats, then it might not be a good idea to convert.","I'd give it five stars because it's such a nice alternative file for handling large amounts of data, I think there's nothing wrong with this one.

In my opinion, ""Pro"" should not mean the most feature rich iteration among several versions in a product lineup. Applying the label pro should mean that it is of suitable substance and quality that a professional within the field related to the product could utilize the product to effectively fulfill their commercial objectives. While I realize that there are multiple depths of professionalism in the field of photography, this product appears to be designed with the newcomer to the serious hobbyist in mind... and the latter is a stretch.

Label of the product aside, Corel Paint Shop Pro X6 Ultimate is a feature rich, intuitive, and downright fun photo tool at a very reasonable price! The bulk of the utility comes from the multitude of quicky-fix features built into the software. The software incorporates truly easy, and effective, Photo Fix options that consistently produce satisfying results. I was also unexpectedly impressed by the ease with which someone of almost any experience level can adjust and potentially improve portraits with the included FaceFilter software; very neat.

I consider this software bundle a gateway bundle. That is, the wide variety of tools and relatively simple interface combined with helpful tutorials and an irresistible price make this the perfect entry point for someone who wants to delve in to the world of creative photography software but is hesitant to spend their children's college savings on a truly professional suite prior to learning the ropes. Honestly, this bundle is also cost efficient enough for someone who is not necessarily serious about photography, but wants the photos they do take to look as nice as possible without getting too complicated.",I was excited to find this product because it's so popular and I was delighted that I was able to order it again and after its 3rd iteration I decided to look past it and read that the pro-bonus

I have been looking for a NON-Adobe product that does more to enhance my photographs than the free program I currently have. This promised great potential, since it is supposed to allow you to layer images, substitute faces, etc.; however, I did not find it lived up to my expectations.

My first clue that this was not the product for me came with its installation. One the one hand, I was impressed that this program came with a CD which I can keep as a back-up, or provided a link to allow me to download a digital version. It also has QR code for users to scan to link them to aps for their Android, iOS and Windows versions for other devices. But then I found out this is an ""all or nothing"" software. I like programs that let me determine what features I want installed on my computer. CyberLink doesn't let you do this. You get everything written onto your hard drive, and you can't disable anything. Not only that, but you get periodical pop-ups that nag you to add this or that for a price.

Like everything else these days, this program wants you to put everything in the Cloud. Not happening! That's a security risk I don't want. My stuff is mine, and I want it to stay that way--particularly creative work. Thankfully, this program gives you the option, but doesn't mandate saving images in the Cloud.

My biggest problem was importing pictures to be able to edit them. In the free version of Picassa (my current photo-editing program), all you do is double-click on a PDF or other image file, and it opens it for viewing (I set it as my default viewer, so it would do this). Then I click a button in the viewing pane that says, ""Edit in Picassa."" Bam! It's there, and I can start playing with it immediately. With PhotoDirector, you have to click File, then Import, and then go through this long rig-a-marrow to bring a photo into the program to edit. With Picassa, once you open a folder and start working on one picture, you can systematically scroll through all the files in that folder and modify them one-by-one. I tried this in PhotoDirector, but never figured out how to make it work.

Making the changes is not as easy or ""intuitive"" as some users made it sound. In most cases, you have to do a lot of clicking, tweaking, checking, etc., to get the enhancement you want. I really hate the crop part, in particular, because it consistently wants to retain the original aspect of the photo, even when you click that you want something else. You can do some fun stuff with people's bodies and faces, but I am not into caricatures as much as correctly representing people. The layering and background modification would be super useful for a graphic artist, but that's not my thing either. If I want to build a great-looking graphic, I find it's a whole lot easier to do it in Publisher.

My biggest beef with this program is how it saves stuff. With Picassa, you get your picture, change it, and then save it directly to the original location. You can either do a simple Control-S or click Save; or to rename and create a new file, do a Save As and put it wherever you please. To delete a file, you just right click and tell the computer to delete it, or drag it to your trash can. With PhotoDirector, it doesn't automatically save a single file to your original folder; you have to tell the program you want it there, and it saves multiple files at once--kind of like when you build an html file. If you want to delete something that has been through PhotoDirect, you have to close the program, or it won't let it go. If you are doing a whole folder of images at once, this gets to be a super time-consuming pain! It also changes the dates on your modified photos, so you don't have a record of when you originally took the picture and then modified it; you just have a set of dates logging the photo as having been created and modified on the day that PhotoDirect had it in its clutches. When you go back some other time to put photos in chronological order to create album pages, as I like to do, this makes your task really hard.

While this program has some cool features for the person with a lot of time on their hands and a truckload of creative energy, it is not for me. I like something quick, simple and direct, that doesn't make me jump through a lot of hoops to get what I want done. I want to control what goes onto my computer, and I don't want a constant barrage of ads to entice me to upgrade to a more expensive package or add features. I will be uninstalling this as soon as possible.","I was looking for a program that will actually help minimize the potential for over-use and the potential for a ""super"" layer.

If it had only been GarageBand it would have been worth the modest cost.  GarageBand is a sturdy, multispectrum, easy to use multi track recording studio.  Its predecessor was pretty basic - but the new version is a substantial update.  The user interface is simpler and more straight forward.  I can now utilize all of the outputs on my mixer (earlier versions limited me to a few at a time).  The loop record function allows me to overdub again and again as I practice a riff - the stacked riffs can be isolated, and cut/pasted into the final mix with remarkable ease.  There is a basic but formidable set of effects, including a very passable compressor, a great limiter to maximize volume without sacrificing quality, almost unlimited mixing capabilities.
But its not just GarageBand - the new iPhoto is a tremendous improvement as well.  I've seen some critical reviews stating that having the library available only within the application is a hassle.  Its actually not.  Its easy enough to sidestep this in any of several ways - import the photos to a separate file before adding them to the iPhoto library - you can then import them into iPhoto from their folders, but here's the benefit! If the drive you import the files to is different from the one you have the iPhoto library on, well then you have just created a backup for the photos.  Its always a good idea too to burn a CD or DVD with those images in case of a system or hardware crash!  I love the new ""events"" feature.  It is so easy to keep track of images now - being able to preview all the images in an event without opening its library is a great time saver.  And I love the interactivity with the internet - I've posted a few web galleries directly from iPhoto - they look great and so far everyone I've invited to look has been impressed both with how easily the galleries work and how stable and fast the are.
iMovie works wonderfully - although I've upgraded and purchased Final Cut Express 8 - iMovie is great for rough cuts, but FCE offers much more diverse tools for polishing!
iWeb is a limited but functional website builder - it lacks the diversity and flexibility of GoLive or Dreamweaver, but then I don't always have the time or the energy to use those applications for very basic informational webbing.
And finally, iDVD does exactly what its supposed to.
I think that is the critical point about all the Apple applications I own - FinalCut Express, Logic Express, iLife and iWork, OSX Leopard.  They do exactly what they advertise, and do it well.  If you have an Apple machine that meets the hardware standards (read that last line again!) then you can't go wrong with these applications!  Once you've bought iLife, make sure to watch the short but helpful training videos on the Apple website.  It will jumpstart your usage!",I was using this set for several years and found helpful despite the cost. I had no idea how much I would spend on a complete set of cd players.

The software optimizes your PC with three closely related sets of programs:

1. 'Protection Plus' includes virus and spyware monitoring, anti-phishing filters and firewall to help keep the bad stuff away from you.
2. 'Performance Plus' optimizes your hard drive and repairs it in case something unwanted manages to get through or whenever you want to fine-tune your system; the set of utilities includes disk defragmentation, unnecessary file cleanup, scandisk for spyware/malware/viruses etc., and a check for security updates from Microsoft.
3. 'Backup and Restore' helps you configure your home network of up to 3 PCs and backup to either CD/DVD or an external device located on your network.

The software is intended to be used with the Live OneCare service where the latest software such as anti-virus definitions are downloaded. Activating the service was easy, and running all three of the services takes only a few minutes. Since the initial install, I have found the minimal time spent maintaining the service to be worthwhile; for example, I set the protection and performance functions to run at night when the computer is not in use.

While one might argue that is is possible to do some of the things that Windows Live OneCare does manually, the point is that you benefit from the software's automation of routine tasks which allows you to spend more time doing the things that you want to do. Additionally, it simply makes sense to be as proactive as possible and there is no better way to do that than to subscribe to a service that is continuously refreshed with the latest patches and security updates. By putting all these services together in a convenient package, Windows Live OneCare saves time and gives you the peace of mind knowing that your computing investment is protected.

Then came Nero, which was light, swift, and powerful.  For those in the know, Nero was the choice application for CD mastering, and later for DVDs.  When I upgraded to Windows 7, I had a few applications that were no longer supported.  Nero 6.x and PowerDVD 5.x were two that I missed most.  When I saw a tremendous deal for Nero 9 Reloaded (free after rebate), I jumped at the chance to use Nero again.  I was excited to see the changes and improvements from 4 major updates (9 and 9 Reloaded are counted as 1 update each).  Despite all the negative reviews, I thought surely it couldn't be that bad.  Right?

PROS:
- Familiar interface
- Good burning performance
- Many multimedia features & tools

CONS:
- Excruciatingly slow install
- Slow startup speeds for every app
- Too many below average apps
- Shameful forced install of Ask.com toolbar
- Updates are not integrated or easy
- Very poor value
- Many apps outperformed by free or open source apps

For the sake of reviewing Nero 9 Reloaded, I chose to install all the applications in the suite.  This amounted to 2.98GB of space required.  I knew I'd uninstall most of the applications but wanted to be thorough.  Nero Burning ROM is 324MB by itself.  At the end of my evaluation, I nearly had to uninstall everything.

INSTALLATION
At the very beginning, I was asked if I wanted to install the Ask.com toolbar and make it my default search engine.  I elected not to install it.  After choosing all the applications to install, I was prompted to install the required 3rd party software, which I was ok with, except that it FORCED me to install the Ask.com toolbar!  What.  The.  Heck???  I timed the actual installation time to be about 22 minutes, during which the installation screen displayed ads for Nero's other applications.  If I were staring at the installation screen for 22 minutes, I think I would have found tips on using Nero 9 to be more useful than watching the same 3 or 4 ads cycle over and over again.  This was a bad start.  After the install completed, I ran the Nero Control Center, which allows you to manage all the apps in the suite including checking for updates.  All it does for updates is open your browser to Nero's web page and you have to see for yourself if the version numbers match or if there is an upgrade available.  The version on the disc I bought was 9.4.17 and version 9.4.26 was available so I downloaded it.  All 204MB worth.  After numerous failed download attempts and even the failure to run once and re-downloading it, I waited an additional 15 minutes for the update to install.  The update forced another couple of 3rd party apps to be installed before completing.  All told, I spent over an hour getting Nero 9 ready to go.

NERO BURNING ROM
Nero Burning ROM was 90% of the reason why I chose to even try Nero 9.  Well, aside from being certified for Windows 7, it is essentially the same as Nero 6.  Even the GUI is remarkably similar.  On the plus side, because I was so familiar with Nero 6, I was able to find everything quickly and get running right away.  Unfortunately, the interface was never a highlight of Nero 6 so it retains the unintuitive characteristics.

NERO SHOWTIME
Showtime is the media player included in the suite and accounted for about 5% of the reason why I wanted to try Nero 9.  Since my old PowerDVD didn't run on Windows 7, I figured Showtime would be a reasonable upgrade from just using Windows Media Player.  While it does offer more options and useful tools, I found that the audio was unacceptable.  Watching Star Trek (2009) on it was a far more enjoyable experience on WMP than Showtime.  The audio was just bland and not very crisp.  What is wrong with this thing?  I tried messing with the audio configuration but nothing really helped.  Bummer.

NERO VISION
Nero Vision allows one to take a video file, from say a Flip camcorder, and burn it to a physical DVD for playback on a standard component DVD player.  Other than adding a few fancy 3D menu templates, it is virtually unchanged from Nero 6.  This was the last 5% of why I wanted to try Nero 9.

REMAINING APPLICATIONS
The rest of the suite is sorely below average.  I would use Audacity over the audio editing tools included in Nero 9 and Picasa or Paint. NET over the photo tools.  I don't have a TV tuner on my PC so I could not review the Nero Live tuner/DVR application but I'd guess more of the same.  The tools like DiscSpeed, DriveSpeed, and InfoTool are ok, but again, you can find free applications that do the same things.  I also did not review the RescueAgent and did not install the free backup software, BackitUp & Burn.

SUMMARY
I thought I would end up writing a review proving all the negative reviewers wrong.  Instead, I am saddened by the mighty fall from grace that Nero has taken.  Nero 9 is the very definition of bloated.  Load times and performance on nearly every application in the suite was painfully slow.  And the only application really worth having, Burning ROM, has changed very little from FOUR versions ago.  Nero sells just the Burning ROM application for Linux at a reasonable cost and wish they would do that also for Windows because the rest of the suite has watered down the value of Nero.  Even then, they would have a hard time competing against a very good free Windows application called CDBurnerXP, which I recommend for those who only need something for data & audio burning and ISO capabilities.  It takes up less than 11MB of hard disk space and installs in less than 30 seconds.  Oh Nero.  Your time is up.","I've been using this for about 1 hour. It took 2 years to get the right software.

As a user of Dictate 1.0, I was very interested in the update to the initial offering. Being on sabbatical from my teaching position while I complete my doctoral dissertation, I have been and am in the midst of a sizable research and writing project. I found Dictate 1.0 to be very helpful initially. However, having to stop your train of thought to try and type in an unrecognized word, became cumbersome. Dictate need a ""Spelling Mode"" desperately.

Enter Dictate 1.2. With a great deal of hope and anticipation, I eagerly awaited my review copy of the update. It seemed like it took years for my friendly neighborhood mail carrier (a rarity in these days of ""Postal"" mail carriers) to deliver my little box of happiness. It finally arrived and I have been using it now for a few weeks.

In February, MacSpeech released version 1.3 of Dictate. I am using the new version and have been impressed with some of the useful new features. Enough of this small talk, let's jump in and see just what Andy (Andrew Taylor - President & Founder - Very nice man) and company have cooked up for the Dictate Fans-O-Plenty.
A BRIEF WORD ABOUT FEATURES
Of course you can go to the product page to get a complete list of product features. We won't add undo length here for that. Suffices to say, from my point of view (after all, I am the one pushing the keycaps here) the major features of Dictate are: Natural Speaking Voice Recognition, Unparalleled (on the Mac platform) Accuracy, Spelling Mode, Phrase Training, Document Cacheing, and the Press the Key/Key Combo commands. We will take a closer look at these important, at least to me, features, so read on... If you dare (cue suspenseful music in the background).
USING DICTATE 1.3
Once you have installed the software, plugged in the included Plantronics USB Headset (nice headset BTW), completed the brief voice recognition training session, and saved your profile you are ready to, Dictate. When starting the program you are presented with a profile activation screen.

Now that you have activated your profile, the program loads the status window, available commands window, and a text window.

Simply turn on the mic (click on the stop sign icon or use the keyboard shortcut: Command+F11) and start dictating or issuing commands to your Mac through the many system commands which come standard with the program.  As if by magic, your words begin to appear on the screen. It really is a wonderful technology. You can also dictate directly into your favorite word processor. I am using AppleWorks (No cracks please. Call me old school, it sounds much less pathetic.) and have found Dictate to work seamlessly within this venerable Mac staple.

Let's say for arguments sake, that you say a word that Dictate does not recognize, ""antediluvian."" Here is where Dictate 1.3 has been greatly improved. In version 1.0, you would have to stop, fiddle around with the program so you could type the word with the keyboard, type the word and try and get the dictation mode to resume (not always an easy thing). With 1.3, you simply say, ""Spelling Mode"" the status windows indicates the mode change and you can then spell the word, adding punctuation as needed. Once you have finished spelling the word, say, ""Dictation Mode"" and you are ready to continue with your natural dictation. The process could be a little smoother (more on this later), but all in all, a vast improvement over 1.0.

We move on from the ability to spell out words from within the program to the ability to train the program to recognize unique phrases. Let's use, ""MyMac.com"" as an example. Saying MyMac.com into the program yielded My Mac.com most of the time. Not too bad, but not right. By saying, ""train the words MyMac.com""  I put the program into Phrase Training Mode which activated the Recognition window.

If the correct version is not listed, simply click in the closest version, make any needed changes, push return and done. Once I gave Dictate a crash course in the linguistics of MyMac.com, it proved to be a studious learner. I haven't had a problem with it recognizing the term since. This is a great feature and will prove helpful for the power user who dictates large blocks of text into the program.

One of the updated features of version 1.3, is an improved ability to cache a document into Dictate thereby allowing you to navigate and edit any document. Bringing some test documents into the program worked well and as expected. This will be helpful for users who want to edit and repurpose archived documents. Nice improvement to an already strong feature set.

While not quite as evolutionary as the ability to spell words into Dictate, two of the new features of 1.3 have greatly improved the overall usability of the program. You can now command Dictate to, ""Press the Key"" or ""Press the Key Combo."" I found these features very useful when one has not taken the time to memorized the proper Dictate commands for a given action. Yeah yeah, I know, but sometimes you just have to, ""GET 'ER DONE!""
MAKING A GREAT PROGRAM EVEN BETTER
There are a couple of areas where Dictate could be refined and improved.  While the new Spelling Mode is a great improvement to the program, the implementation is a little cumbersome to use. The switching of modes greatly reduces the flow of naturally speaking your text into the program. If one could quickly spell a word seamlessly into the dictation process, this would help the writers who would like to use this program a great deal.

MacSpeech has noted that one should not attempt to use the mouse or keyboard while Dictate is running. Indeed, this is a no no. The program becomes unstable and dictation is sporadic at best. Once the mic was turned off, editing within the document was possible. I would great if Dictate could allow keyboard and or mouse interaction while it is running.

Switching between programs while Dictate is running can cause some stability issues. Of course, in this multitask world, one must be able to shift gears from time to time. The program needs a little refinement in this area.
MYMAC RATING
All refinements and improvements aside, this is a great program that will allow you to dictate large blocks of standard text (sans highly technical terms, and nonstandard words which must be spelled) naturally and accurately. Realizing that with a few refinements this great program could be even better, I am, with proper diction and elocution, giving MacSpeech Dictate 1.3 an enthusiastic MyMac rating of 4.5 out of 5.","I was first introduced to this product in Madera in the early 90's and for some years had them ship me the product until I found a suitable user.

There's a decent video editor for creating your own videos, capturing and conversion of videos for different devices, and the usual tools for ripping and burning Cds, enhancing photos, and backing up or copying data.
After a long installation, I began looking at each feature.  It took me several tries to get the VideoWave feature to open after receiving the same error message.  VideoWave is good for importing a media file and then editing with text, transitions, audio, and video effects.  You can easily share your file on social media.

The rest of the programs  like photo editing, ripping or burning a CD, or backing up data  I have free software that do all of these things.  It's convenient to have all of these in one suite, but for me, unecessary, as I will not be using more than one program at a time anyway.

I had hoped the DVD video conversion feature would allow  me to convert DVDs I own in order to put them on my smartphone, but this does not work with copy-protected media.

The latest Norton product, Norton 360 3.0 is the best of their scanner products thus far.

The major change is that where previous software took up  a huge amount of CPU while not even scanning and slowed down the performance of my PC, this product doesn't do that. It's not as intrusive as far as CPU usage is concerned. Be forewarned however that it does significantly slow down the PC when scanning. The best thing to do at that point is to go grab a sandwich and watch some TV or go out while the scanning process is going on.

This product was also able to pick up infected files that were missed by other scanner such as AVG.

Overall, it's a great product.","I was not attracted to this product because the price was so great. I bought on a regular basis and found myself experimenting with different softwares to help my PC keep its speed up and running smoothly. However, I was not at"

Installation happens with InstallShield. During installation you are asked to agree to the Privacy Policy of the Moovie Live service. Unfortunately the long privacy policy is shown in a very small window that only shows six lines of text at a time. You can choose to Skip instead of Accepting the policy but you won't have access to this service which brings up details about the movie you are watching. The DVD also includes free trials of two other programs from the same company and a PDF version of the user manual (in the UG/enu/ directory).

When you run the program for the first time, you enter the product key (which you can find on the DVD sleeve) to activate the software. You are then prompted to register, but you can skip registration if you like. Then the program shows a reminder to download the latest patch from the Cyberlink website which is 90MB! The patch is like installing the program for a second time! When you visit the Upgrade option again (Setup, Upgrade button) the patch is still shown. Check the file name - to make sure you don't get stuck in an infinite loop of upgrades. This is not like Windows Update that automatically does not show already installed updates!

The program has a number of settings and customizations on both playback and the software in itself, but you cannot customize everything. The DVD playback options and adjustments are many.

The user interface itself is on the sluggish side, and switching from classic to cinema mode takes a lot longer than one would think. It's as if they are starting a separate program?

There are a few annoyances with the program: smaller options windows that come up within the application are hard to separate from the main PowerDVD window... The software starts on a latest movie splashscreen which has nothing to do with your actual DVD. This is the ""Moovie Line"" feature which you can turn off in the settings. One would think that a program named PowerDVD would prioritize the playing of DVDs but I digress... Of the silly things the movie industry does, you only get five region-code changes for BluRay playback. This is just stupid. Why does the movie industry work so hard to get their customers to hate them?... At times the user interface feels more like a website instead of an actual program, and that's not a good thing.

I find 3D with current technology more of a gimmick, so I don't really care for 3D at the moment. I did not contact customer support so I can't comment on them.

You can control the program with apps on your smartphone or tablet. The PowerDVD Remote app is available for free on iTunes and the Android Market. After you have the Power DVD software running on the desktop computer, you launch the app, enter a 4-digit device code on the mobile app, and you are good to go as they link up together. The 4-digit code is under the Device tab on the Power DVD desktop software. The device code is the same for every device you connect, so you may want to write it down or memorize it, that way you can connect multiple devices faster. The app worked successfully without issue on the iPod Touch, and Google Play devices (smartphone and tablet).

I actually had a iPod Touch and an Android device connected simultaneously to the PowerDVD desktop software and they both worked at the same time. I used one as a touchpad remote, and the other as a buttons remote. (you don't need two devices though, you can easily switch between touchpad control and buttons control within the same PowerDVD Remote app).

Overall, I am happy with the DVD playback of this software and its many options.

So this is my first Mac version, but I've been around the software before and use it extensively with ancestry.com sync features.  At first glance, FTM for the Mac 3 Deluxe seems to be fairly feature complete, on par with the Windows version.  Of course, it's also a bit sluggish, which I've come to expect from the FTM products.

Now, while I have used FTM for a number of years, by no means am I a genealogical expert.  It's all personal use and it often comes in spurts.  I use the software to update a family tree on occasion and likely don't come back to it for several months to a year.  Like other FTM products, it comes with a three month subscription to ancestry.com.  Syncing with the online tree is great and has been much improved over the years.

It does an excellent job of tracking changes and keeping your tree(s) in sync.  The interface is nice with a UI that is easy to navigate.  There are plenty of printing and viewing options.  There are times that grabbing online content and waiting for things to process is sluggish.  Again, I've grown accustomed to this over the years with FTM.  Each version seems to get a little better, but there's often a few quarks to get used to.  Overall, a nice family tree product with syncing and plenty of features to keep you busy on your various genealogical projects.","I've used a number of software products and services that are on par with the latest software and I'm sure they will too.

Its main problem is that Windows XP is also a superb operating system, and most users will have difficulty understanding why we needed more than an incremental upgrade from XP. To the extent that the Vista interface deviates from the XP menus, I mostly have found this to be simply irritating.

The main flaw with Vista is that it deliberately did not have backwards compatibility with many earlier-version Window drivers.  Some printers and other devices flat out would not work with Vista.  This was an outrageous decision by Microsoft and it ultimately doomed the operating system with many users and businesses as word of this incompatibility got around.  Windows 7 essentially corrected this fatal mistake years later.

That having been said, Vista with SP1 is very solid and reliable. In my experience on my Notebook computer, however, be advised that it runs a LOT faster and better with plenty of DRAM. It seems to need more DRAM to run well. My new Intel dual-core Notebook came with 1GB DRAM, which was usually enough in Windows XP (except for most imaging software, which needed at least 2GB). However, I splurged and upgraded the computer to 4GB DRAM, and the difference was literally night-and-day. Vista could get doggy with 1GB. With 4 GB DRAM it literally screams on my Intel dual-core machine.

One unforgivable lapse on the part of Microsoft with Vista Home Premium is that it does not include Fax support. In this day and age, this is truly astounding. This represents a very obnoxious decision by someone.

The Vista interface is prettier. What more can I say?

One thing I think that Microsoft needs to watch is the security options. Security features are all well and good, but at the end of the day the beauty of a microcomputer is that it frees most of us, most of the time, from dependence on the IT crew in the white labcoats. XP and Vista have so many security protocols that in some instances it is rekindling this dependence.

Overall, I am satisfied with Vista, and I would not hesitate again to buy a computer that came pre-loaded with it.

Fast forward a year later I have already written several applications to monitor enterprise systems, I've create applications to expedite the way we support stores and created a release scheduling tool and intranet website to share the information across the company.

I will say that this isn't a perfect program. I have often times had the program crash on me and offer to let me debug Visual studio while I was running visual studio debugging an app I wrote...

Summary

Everybody doing drafting today knows AutoCAD. It's so broadly used that you will find several alternate use models that AutoCAD is overkill. AutoCAD LT 2012 perfectly fits a number of these: Laptop/Travel/Customer Conferences - using LT on a laptop, less than AutoCAD, with perfect compatibility. There is no better method to review and modify sketches (except AutoCAD).

2D Drafting: AutoCAD 2012 LT is all that's necessary. There's nothing a 2D draftsman needs this package doesn't offer. Note however, none of AutoCAD's three dimensional abilities are incorporated.

If you know AutoCAD and are comfortable with AutoCAD but don't need 3D, AutoCAD LT is the best substitute. If you want similar functionality with the option of 3D support, CorelCAD might be the software choice for you.

Initially, I did a full scan, and that took almost 2-1/2 hours to complete!  All it found was a couple of minor items (like cookies) that I tend to delete periodically anyways. Otherwise, surfing the net was pretty easy.  The program is unobtrusive, and does not annoy you with tons of pop-ups.  Guards are categorized into ""browser"" ""cookie"" ""file"" ""immunizer"" ""keylogger"" ""network"" ""process"" and finally ""startup"".  The best way, IMO, to avoid malware, is to be smart about which sites you visit and have a healthy respect for unrecognized email address/attachments.  I also delete temp files and cookies regularly - which is very easy to do in Firefox or Internet Explorer.  I find that site checkers are really useful in surfing the web - unfortunately, I did not see that feature in this program.

But I'm not thrilled about the product to be honest.  I have 3 issues with norton:

1.  It is relentless in hassling you about renewals.  It gets a bit much when you are in the middle of something and the norton window blows you out of the game you were playing and such.

2.  One of the major benefits used to be the inclusion of an emergency boot disk when you bought norton.  Not anymore.  Now you open up the box and there is a single piece of paper with a ridiculously long code you have to go to the website and enter (really guys?  You can't use one of those codes that the camera can scan?)

3.  The virus protection isn't ""all that"".  I have an annoying virus on my laptop that norton seems to be helpless about.  I can google it, and find lots of people that have it, it's not some obscure one, yet running virus scans on norton always misses it.  It makes me wonder what ELSE norton is missing.

Still, I think the others are worse, and I do like that buying one product lets me install it on my laptop and desktop machines, and that a single subscription is managed in the cloud.  I do like that.  I just wish the product were a bit better... I feel like they are milking this product without improving it anymore, and in fact letting it rot a bit.

Install was pretty easy and although I have previous experience with AutoCAD, the layout is simple enough where first-timers can jump right in fairly quickly with minimal experience. I did experience some crashing and locking up however.  I can't even begin to describe how frustrating this is.  I installed it separately on two different workstations and both had the same issues.  It didn't happen enough for me to change my rating on the product, but it is still pretty annoying. There are not too many visual differences between it and AutoCAD 2011.  I hate the Dashboard ribbon, but fortunately you can get around this by selecting ""AutoCAD Classic Workspace.""  I find that things also run much more smoothly by turning off Autocomplete and Dynamic Input.  There is a lot of room for customization within the program and you can set things up pretty much any way that is most convenient to you.

I started out doing some simple designs of my office's data flow, and drafted some plans of our office structure. Doing a data flow diagram, I tend to use the copy function a lot.  AutoCAD 2012 has a lot more features and copy options now that made this much easier to accomplish, including cleanup tools like the ability to merge duplicate objects and removed nested objects that share the same geometry, which it will recognize as unnecessary. Some of my diagrams can get fairly complicated and squashed together, so this is definitely a plus and made things easier.  I will upload a copy of the diagram I was able to complete in the customer images section.

Overall, I think that AutoCAD may be following in Adobe's footsteps and starting to create ""bloatware"" by trying to add too many features and visual aspects, like unnecessary toolbars to their products, so I hope it doesn't continue with AutoCAD 2013.  But if you're looking for a budget 2D drafting option and still want the option to exchange formats with those using the full CAD software, AutoCAD 2012 is the way to go.

The interview questions help you through most of it, but I did get stumped a few times.

This could have just been my inexperience with the whole process or not accurately interpreting the 'help' info provided.

Having everything in front of me and entering data as I went along was easy. Once the federal return is complete, the State return kind of does itself.

While this wasn't what I'd call 'simple', it was easier than sitting down with sheets of paper and a booklet, trying to make sense of it all. Calculations are automatically done for you, and deductions are maximized. Questions are generally very clear and explanations as to the nuances of what things are 'covered' are concise and in layman's terms.

This software definitely helped me to maximize our deductions, and gain insight into what I can do this year to help us for next years taxes. It made seeing the bigger picture easier than it had been in the past for my husband too.

-----------------------------

The best thing about this software is the quantity and quality of information I received from doing our taxes this way. It made me think about next year, and relieved that it's likely to be a much easier process with this e-file done and in the system.

I liked that H&R's software provided us with glitch-free filing. A print and mail-in option was available (a way to save the twenty bucks on your state filing with a longer wait for a refund) , but since I heard that both my federal and state returns were accepted within 1 hour of submitting them via e-file, the twenty bucks spent on the state return was well worth it for both a quick refund and peace of mind.

I will definitely use this software next year, and recommend it to others.

-----------------------------------

UPDATE 4/8/15:

Received confirmation of acceptance of both State and Federal returns within 5 hours of filing them. Federal tax payment was taken out of my account within 8 hours of that confirmation, and we received a deposit of our refund from the State within 7 days.

I feel like this was a much more comprehensive way to to our taxes than the old paper version, and I'm relieved that next year we'll be all set to do it again using H&R!",I have been using this for over 40 years and this is how I got started. I had zero tax liability for the first time and I didn't realize that I could pay full due to the software. The point is that when I get

As a graphic designer, I do a lot of work for companies that build new homes or apartment communities. I receive CAD files from their architects and I have to import them into Adobe Illustrator and manipulate them to use in marketing materials.

The CAD files I receive are usually bogged down with details that I don't want and ultimately, I spend a lot of time deleting lots of unnecessary lines and marks. Additionally, once a file is exported, it loses some details that I do need and I end up going back and forth with the client to get the missing information.

Being able to open the CAD files from the architects and manipulate them before exporting is a huge plus for me.
Since I have never used a CAD program I have nothing to compare it to but I will comment on the functionality of it as it pertains to my work and work within other vector based and layered programs like Adobe Illustrator.

AutoCAD Lt was easy enough to install. The disk self-launches and walks you through your install options, including the ability to choose your industry thereby offering tools and menus to meet your needs. I use Windows XP (although it is compatible with all versions of Vista) with 3GB of RAM. AutoCAD recommends at least 2GB of RAM. Installation requires 721 MB of free disk space. You also need to be connected to the Internet during install. CPU type needed is documented as follows: Windows XP - Intel Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon(tm) Dual Core processor, 1.6 GHz or higher with SSE2 technology Windows Vista - Intel Pentium 4 or AMD Athlon Dual Core processor, 3.0 GHz or higher with SSE2 technology. I'm running on 2.4 GHz Intel Core2.

Display resolution should be 1024 x 768 with True Color. It is also 64-bit compliant.

In the box you receive one install disk, a card with support information, and some nice `postcards' - almost mini manuals - covering a small variety of topics like Getting Started, PDF Enhancements, and Application Menu. There are 9 cards in all with great graphics and tips.

There is a great on screen help menu broken down into three tabs per topic: Concept, Procedure and Quick Reference.

AutoCAD is a memory hog but so are all my other graphics programs. I ran it with Illustrator and had no problem.

The installation and reboot corrupted my preference file for my WACOM graphics tablet. I deleted the file and rebooted and all was well even with AutoCAD reopened. Since many engineers/architects may use a graphics tablet, be aware that this may happen.

The first thing I did was to open a very comprehensive site plan CAD file, saved by the architect as a DWG file. I'm not sure what version of AutoCAD the file originated in but I had no trouble opening it. I was warned of a couple incompatibilities that didn't seem to affect the drawing.

I was able to see all the layers and view the file in just the layers I needed or as a complete set. The most important thing to me was the ability to export the file into a PDF, keeping its vector attributes. The best part is that in Acrobat (and I'm running full version, not Reader) there is a list of layers that you can turn off as groups or individually.

The PDF file imported into Illustrator and gave me all the editing capabilities I needed.

Since I will not be using it to create drawings, I'm not sure how many of tools I'll learn how to use - it's hard to teach an old dog a new program - but I'll be spending more time looking at import and export options to give me even greater control.

Overall, this is a great investment for someone like me and even more so for someone who needs a great CAD program for design and mechanical layout. It comes at a big price but when I think of the time I spend trying to work with exported CAD files that are not to my specifications, it will pay for itself easily before one project is complete.","I was really excited to find this program, and I couldn't pass it up. Sadly, I returned to the studio that I had originally purchased and when I got home, I got a lot of work done on my project."

That said, there are some things to consider about this product.

1) It's main claim to fame is the convenience it offers in protecting multiple devices in a relatively painless manor.
2) This is really a product for multiple WINDOWS devices, although you can add iOS and Android devices, but I wouldn't recommend it, especially on iOS devices.  iPhones, iPads, etc., really have their own set of protection services that makes Norton unnecessary. The only advantage to using this on a iOS device is you can wipe, locate, or lock an iPhone or iPad remotely from one central web interface, but you can already do that via Apple anyway, so it's a bit redundant.
3) Protection is not created equal across all devices. There's no browser support for safe web surfing or phishing protection for Google Chrome on Mac.
4) Only Norton Internet Security is installed on Windows, and not the full suite offered in Norton 360, which costs less. Not sure why I should pay more for less.

You start out completely overwhelmed and awkward, with random things popping up at odd moments, spending a lot of time trying to figure out what the hell you just did. Over time (and I've spent a lot of time) your movements become less spastic, less awkward. You start drafting without thinking about it. One day you realize you've completely mind-melded with the program. One hand is on the stylus, the other playing chords on the  keyboard. Steam is rising from your fingertips. Blueprints and floorplans appear on screen as if by magic.

I'd never used Sketchbook before getting this version. But if I didn't know this program was made by Autodesk, I probably would have figured it out. Because it does for graphic illustration what Autocad does for drafting. Yes, you can drill down through endless menus to get to windows and functions.  But you can also click *just here* and drag *just so* and lo and behold your brush is now a marker and your stroke is now green and half-saturated and ten point. Whomp.

The tools are inspired by actual drawing tools - no splines, just a french curve (works just like the real one). No snap-to-grid, but instead orthographic projection underlays (I do wish those allowed a bit more line variation, instead of forcing the snap). The new ""flipbook"" function has no tweening, but it was clearly designed with storyboards in mind. If you have a pressure sensitive stylus, like the Wacom Intuos, you can emulate brush strokes frighteningly well. There are of course layers, and undo.

Architects who trained on Autocad cringe at the thought of using something like Illustrator for drafting. Wizard-level programmers who trained on Emacs would rather eat their own liver than use Word. I have no doubt there are graphic artists who feel the same way about Sketchbook.","I've used this stuff for a long time and I've always found it useful.

Ive been using CorelDraw for about 20 years now, maybe longer, and the thing thats always made it my digital graphics and photo editing software of choice is that it gives you the most bang for your buck. That hasn't changed, and the software has only gotten better over the years. There are, however, a few things Im not exactly happy about when it comes to CorelDraw X7. Theyre not huge issues, and CorelDraw is still better than the competition even in these areas, but . . .

Lets start, though, with what makes this graphics suite the best buy.

Back when I was studying computer graphics, I would take the lessons I learned at college on their Macs running Adobe software and applied them at home on my PC in CorelDraw. While the interfaces looked different, the two were mostly the same. Some of the other layout artists at the newspaper where I worked had spent two thousand and up for their Apple computersplus an additional thousand for each piece of software. Not a suite of graphic-design programs, but each individual program. I spent under a thousand for my computer and only a few hundred dollars for one graphics suite that did the work of two of their thousand-dollar programsthe one for graphic design and the one for photo editing. A few years later I met the head of a design company who told me the designers who worked under her would work with Adobe software on their Macs, and she would edit their work with CorelDraw on her PC.  Its always seemed to me that buying Adobe software is like buying jeans with a designer label. Youre paying so much more for the label, but is it worth it? I don't think so. Id much rather buy the same pair of jeans at a third of the price without the fancy-schmancy label.

Over the years, the differences in value became even more obvious. CorelDraw, which remained significantly cheaper, came with a bunch of filters installed; and I was shocked to discover that my Adobe-loving friends were paying extrajust for filters!  Even more recently, Adobe has switched to a subscription model that costs $600 a yeara yearfor Creative Cloud, which means the large majority of Adobes professional consumers don't even get to own the software at that price! They only get to use it for a year, after which they have to pay another $600 if they want to continue using it for another year. That means they're paying more just to rent Adobe software than they would be if they bought CorelDrawwhich they can keep and use forever.

That designer label is just getting more and more expensive.

When it comes to graphic design and photo editing, CorelDraw still keeps up pretty much neck-and-neck with Adobe. The one major advantage that Adobe has over CorelDraw (aside from the whole designer-label thing and the fact that most graphic-design courses are taught using Adobe software) is that Adobes  suite includes Dreamweaver, which is the undisputed industry leader in web design. The CorelDraw Standard Membership that comes with CorelDraw X7 allows you do download Corel Website Creator, but Website Creator is nothing fancy (although it is easy enough to use). Its about as far from Dreamweaver as possible, and it feels like it was added just to answer the Adobe fans who might ask, But does CorelDraw let you design websites? Yeah, it does, but probably no nearly as well as youd like.

So what are these little things that are bothering me about CorelDraw X7, aside from that weak website design program?

First off, it feels like a lot of the new interface was designed to appeal to new users, particularly users who are accustomed to Adobe, users who are used to paying for extras. As a long-time CorelDraw user, that bugs me.

The first thing I saw when a first opened CorelDraw X7 was a window telling me I had 0 days left on my premium membership. I thought that was weird. How can I have 0 days left on a membership related to a new piece of software I had just installed? It turns out that CorelDraw X7 comes with a standard membership. Whats the difference? Aside from $99 a year, Im not really sure. Premium membership includes free upgrades if CorelDraw gets upgraded during your year of premium service. It also comes with fonts and other graphics I haven't been able to see to determine if they're worth the price.

The suite also comes with free warranty service that doesnt last very long and comes with email reminders suggesting you consider their valuable Premium Training & Support Plan. Youll get exclusive access to our product experts with unlimited first-in-line phone support, personalized One-on-One Training on any topic of your choice [two sessions], unlimited access to product webinars and peace of mind with complete software back-up protection. This only costs $99 a year, which isn't bad, but . . . it bugs me.

Corel Connect is a new program within this suite that lets you search for useable images and the like that you can download. It lets you search Flickr and CorelDraws new Content Exchange, but youll probably quickly find (like I did) that most free images and graphics aren't that great. Corel Connect also lets you search Fotolia and iStock, which have great images but charge for them. Again, its not a lot of money (most small images can be purchased for a less than a dollar and a half if you buy enough credits), and it makes sense. It just . . . bugs me.

I used to be able to say that CorelDraw came with everything, that you don't have to pay more for extras. And you still dont. But the program makes you feel like spending more is highly encouraged. Its not a big deal, but it bugs me.

There are other little things I found annoying, like the Gallery tab on the Welcome Screen that comes with lots of pretty pictures and no explanation whatsoever. And the fact that the Help menu isn't searchable. And the fact that I seem to have run into the suggestion that I Go Premium without any real explanation as to why I would want to do that a lot. Seriously, if the additional premium content is so great, cant we at least have a look at it? Of course, its possible that we can but how just isn't clear. And that bugs me.

As Ive already said, you don't really need any of these extras; and even if you do decide to buy them, they do all seem reasonably priced, particularly in comparison to Adobes $600 a year just to rent their creative suite. And overall, CorelDraw X7 is a great graphics suite. I started using it after CorelDraw X6 kept crashing on me during a big project, and X7 didn't crash at all. Even with the drawbacks, CorelDraw Graphics Suite is still the best bang for your buck, and thats the bottom line.",I've always found the Macbook Pro Professionnel to be very good.

Since I use the 3 license version, I have installed Kaspersky on my 2007 Dell Vostro 1000 laptop (1GB RAM) w/Windows XP Home, and my 2004 Dell Dimension 8300 (2.5GB RAM) w/Windows XP Pro - both with 120 GB hard drives. See below for my HP Mini 210-XXXX netbook install.**

I would like to say the installation had a quirk in it so will give some helps here:

THIS IS FOR WINDOWS XP:
After the install program verified and extracted files, I agreed to two separate agreements, then it checked for program compatibilty and said it would automatically remove Norton Live Update (I have Norton Systemworks but not anti-virus). Then you are told that you have to reboot ""to continue the installation"" and are given Three (3) choices:

1) Reboot NOW and continue to install

2) (don't reboot) Click Continue but your install might fail.

3) Cancel the install.

When you choose ""1"" it reboots then makes you agree to the same two agreements, say to automatically remove the incompatible files/programs and choose 1, 2 or 3 again.  Also all of the programs in your systray are back again after the instructions had told you to close them.

If you chose 1 again, the same thing happens over and over again -- So choose 2 AFTER the first reboot. AND I didn't think to close the programs the second time but had NO problems occurred with either computer.

You really don't want to wait to install a new version of the software because you have to update the databases from whenever the program came out -- like July of 2011 or before.  Mine took about 8 or more hours with 4 or 5 updates.  I think it didn't do them all at once.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Netbook install: I have an HP Mini 210-xxxx netbook with 1GB Memory, 250GB harddrive, Windows 7 Starter OS.
After going to the website to download the software, the install was very easy, did not have any of the quirks above, only asked for agreements to the installs and, once installed, the updates were very quick.  It is a faster computer so everything was faster.

ALSO, I had to purchase another 1PC license of this same program to install on a new desktop with Windows 7 Premium.  It was fast and had the same type of install.  Both the new computer and the year old netbook have a different interface icon --- rectangle that looked like and old monitor and flat desktop design with icons on the front and side.  This was the same for both of my computers that use Windows 7.  The icon for the Win XP OS is round.

What I like is the program sets everything up for you and you don't have to choose all of the settings but you can go in and do that later if you want.  There are many features and programs available -- see the information on the Amazon's product page.

The new 2012 version seems not to slow down my computers and takes care of the updates without interrupting your work. It does update faster when you are not using the computer, though.

Admittedly, you have to do some head scratching from time to time to figure out where things are...how do to what you were used to doing without even thinking in the older version. Doing a copy/paste activity is a good example of this.

So, there is a learning curve to this, which can be daunting.  But, if you're patient and take the time to learn, you will find that the process of editing or making changes eventually becomes much faster (less clicks) than the previous formats.

I really don't mind, even like, the ribbon feature.  You can customize it so it only includes what you use the most often.

Also, other reviews have mentioned this, but be aware that upon installation you should selcted ""customize"" instead of ""upgrade,"" else you will loose certain programs in the previous version (in my case, MS Outlook 2003, which I had to reinstall).

For example, the taskpane that now appears stage-left (screen- right) does more than display a stacked clipboard; if you've been repeating a series of formatting commands, those too appear in the stack for easy access.  This is what computers have promised to deliver for some time now.  In this and other ways, Microsoft is finally bringing it to users in a usable, intuitive manner.
Previous features such as spellchecking, grammar, integration and smart cut-copy-paste operations are all present.  Perhaps the best addition to the suite is Microsoft's OneNote, which promises to capture freeform notes and text in whatever way you like, digitizing tablet handwriting or keyboard entry; the killer app is how it recognizes the handwriting and indexes the text for finding your notes again.  Call it system-wide Graffiti for Windows.
Still, this is Office and the usual bloat in disk space, system requirements, and price tag all apply.  This is a release most-targeted for businesses that can afford to roll this out to many users under a favorable license.  If a company such as GE had to pay $450 a seat, you can bet GE would be using a competitor's product tomorrow.  So for an individual, Office is still a four-star player.
For anyone considering Office 2003, let me weigh in with a wet blanket on previous rave reviews: if you have Office 2000/2002/XP, you don't need this release.  Honestly.  This iteration does not contain a truly compelling feature set that will bring you to spend a few hundred dollars.  Microsoft's OneNote is good, maybe even killer, but you've gotten along without it for quite some time now, haven't you?
To put all this in a single paragraph: if you're on Office 97 or earlier, and can score the upgrade, and have the bucks, this is a good release to use.

Well, after trying this latest version, I'm happy to report that it appears they too have jumped on the recent bandwagon of lighter leaner anti-virus products.  This version is much better than the last version I tried (approx. 2004-2005).  The installation was a little time-consuming but otherwise simple and trouble-free. Afterward, there was an option to optimize scanned files to improve scanning time.  The optimization took fifteen minutes to complete.  I then selected how frequently I wanted the program to update. The most frequent option is every four hours, which I selected. This particular two-year license is for one computer only.

The interface is neatly minimalist.  It offers plenty of advanced options within it's sub-menus for power users to tweak, yet, the main menu remains simple and manageable for less-technical users.  There is a menu bar at the top and twelve icons in the main area for the anti-virus, anti-spyware, anti-spam, firewall, linkscanner, anti-rootkit, system tools, e-mail scanner, identity protection, license, web shield, and resident shield.  Double-clicking an icon brings up the respective feature. From the menu bar on the left, the feature can then be launched or tweaked. The features and additional options are also available from the drop down menu.

On-demand scanning performance was pretty good. A full scan at default settings took exactly 15 minutes. I completed the initial optimization beforehand, which supposedly speeds up scanning, so I can only assume scans would be slower if optimization is skipped. You can also perform separate rootkit scans.  The firewall is pretty standard and did not interfere with any web processes, home network, or networked devices such as printers.  I do not use POP mail anymore (web access is the safest way to protect against spam and viruses), therefore, I can't tell you about the spam and POP protection.  I did try to test it with the native mail client in Windows Vista but I couldn't get it to work.  I tried checking AVG's system requirements on their web site, however, they only listed server-side programs (Exchange, Sendmail, SharePoint) in their application compatibility, but no desktop clients.  Weird...  I'm still trying to figure out exactly how the identity protection feature works.  There is no option to enter protected data.  It seems more like an additional layer of active malware and phishing monitoring than protection of specific sensitive data.  There are no parental control features offered.

Linkscanner, which was recently acquired by AVG, works pretty well with IE or Firefox.  It's similar to Siteadvisor, except Linkscanner actually scans links in real-time instead of relying on a database.  There is an option to install the AVG browser toolbar, which includes Yahoo as the default search provider.  You can change it, but don't look for Google or Bing.  Your choices are Baidu, WebHledani, or Yandex (if you're scratching your head and asking ""Who?!?!"", trust me, you're not alone).  Thankfully, you can still use the default search box.  Browsing was not slowed or otherwise noticeably negatively impacted.

Speaking of system resource impact, it seems pretty minimal.  I installed it on a PC containing a 3.0 Ghz P4 with 1 GB of RAM and running Windows Vista Professional.  I have not observed any noticeable lag during normal operations, start-up, or shutdown. So far, AVG seems pretty stable and effective.

The only features I found lacking were identity controls and the absence of any parental controls.  I think in this day and age, children are particularly vulnerable.  The fact that this ""Internet Security"" suite provides no parental control whatsoever is a glaring omission.  Linkscanner might help prevent the kiddies from inadvertently picking up a drive-by download, but it won't keep them off inappropriate sites or seedy chat rooms, where trouble usually lurks.  Also, I wish the identity control was more configurable.  I'd like the peace of mind that specific sensitive information is actively filtered and blocked from being released without my consent.  These two complaints aside, AVG offers plenty of  useful features in a stable easy to use package.","I was using this software mostly for testing and then running the application. After the initial installation, I ran into troubleshooting issues. The problem is solved by the software can be found online. It is free to run, but you still"

The full version of QuickBooks for Windows is a godsend for small businesses, with just about every feature every small- to medium-sized business needs.

The Mac version is pared down, though. I'm not going to go through all the features it has and doesn't have. For a business investment like this, you really need to go look at the full list of features yourself on the Intuit website.

What I wanted to impart here, though, is that QuickBooks for Mac 2013 provides an easy, intuitive bookkeeping interface and it's very fast. No chugging through calculations or report generation. Everything I've tried pops up very quickly and accurately. You can customize report forms easily--both for data and for look. You can easily track multiple accounts. It doesn't do payroll--go to Windows for that, or use an online service.

I use QuickBooks now to manage my own freelance business as well as the finances of a small nonprofit organization I run. It's easy to set up invoices and create product or service entries that track to specific types of income or expense lines. It's easy to mark the invoice paid when the check or online payment comes in. It's easy to keep your check registers up to date. And, of course, you can wrap it all up and just give your QuickBooks file to your accountant at the end of your fiscal year and he or she can import all the data and take care of your filings.

Simple and fast. Just make sure you check the feature lists online to be sure it does what you really, really need.","I purchased this based largely on the features and the cost-effectiveness of the machine.

I've also used an OS 9 and 10 Mac.  None of them matches Windows XP.  It is simply the best, hands down.  I even like it better for using Photoshop and Illustrator than a Mac and that statement is virtually heresy in the art world! First, it is not buggy and not crash prone.  It reliably works all of the time.  Windows 2000 was very good in that regard and XP is even better. 95 and 98 were terrible regarding crashes and reliability. I'm also using Windows Media Player 9 with it, which is a terrific player, and I'm even able to use all wma files (1/3 the size) rather than mp3 after using a converter. I stopped using Real Player after getting on this Player 9, which works the best with XP.  Second, if I need help on something on my computer, I can have my friend in a different city, also on XP, take over my controls using the Net Meeting feature.  He was able to reinstall a program for me that was giving me fits.  Third, there are loads of special programs that work especially in conjunction with XP that further enhance it, such as Firegraphic 5 where you can see all your images and view them in filmstrips, slide shows and big versions. And that's just one of many special programs that I've used on XP.  It is also a delight to go to any website and find that whatever you can download there is compatible with XP.  One thing that would really turn me off a Mac, by contrast, is the notice on many programs or features on the web that they haven't developed a version yet for a Mac.  I also like the way Windows Explorer works in XP and that it looks better than in any earlier version of Windows.

This is a major evolution from Roxio's roots as a CD/DVD burning software. By making the software so comprehensive Roxio has made it much more memory intensive and time consuming to install and explore. It's got a lot of useful resources for editing video (works with HD and 3D video) and audio and converting between formats, so if you do a lot of multimedia editing this is helpful, but if you just need something to burn or rip CDs, DVDs, or Blu-Ray then this software is unnecessary given the simpler alternatives that are available. For Blu-Ray an additional plugin for authoring must be purchased separately from Roxio if you just have this standard edition of NXT 3. I found that this software is a lot to install and explore - it has lots of impressive features and can function as a multimedia production studio package. For 3D and HD video you will want a fast processor and lots of available storage. This software is something that will take some time to master, and it is only for Windows operating systems.

Wow -- sounds impressive, but for the life of me, I can't find a list of said file types.  I wondered which they might be?  So, I just started fiddling, converting whatever I could find....

They seem to have done a fairly good job of making sure conversions of Microsoft Office docs would stay intact.  No significant problems there on any of the Office 2002-2007 file types I tried.

But, when I switched to graphics files, results got a little less useful.  There are 4 default quality level settings for converting images (or documents with images).  What I noticed was on the default settings, even when one selects a format that one would think would economize on file size, converted documents became massively larger.  For example, a simple JPEG conversion set to ""General"" quality has as its compression defaults a bicubic ""downsample"" to a ""medium"" quality JPEG at 150dpi.  Sounds reasonable.  The problem?  Compressing this sample JPEG file in ""downsample"" mode creates an 11.8MB PDF from a 4.96MB file that was originally at 300dpi (2743x1822 pixels).  So, if one is ""compressing"" the dpi of this image by cutting it in half (300dpi to 150dpi), then why in the world does this program output a file that is nearly 2.5 times as large?  I actually had a few examples were increased in size tenfold using the same defaults!  This makes no sense, and this flaw would apply to any document that contains graphics -- not just graphics files themselves.  True, one can go into the settings, create and name a new default compression ratio and experiment away, but as slick as this UI is, and as intuitive as it seems to be, why require such fiddling?  I thus moved on to other file types.

I ran into no major problems converting OpenOffice text (Writer; .odt) docs to PDFs through the interface, but trying to convert OpenOffice spreadsheets (Calc; .odf and .ods) created really ugly formatting problems with gaps between cells, unfilled voids, and formatting errors, most notably not centering the document but, instead, smashing it up against the top and corner of the ""page.""  I could find no ways to influence the formatting of OpenOffice spreadsheets, and since that program itself outputs to PDFs much more reliably (big improvements in their later releases), there's really no use for Corel's product there.

After seeing these two file-types so mangled in final PDF docs, I had seen enough.  However....

I am impressed that Corel went so far as to offer encryption and security settings on converted PDF docs (that must have taken some negotiating with Adobe), but the fact that there is no scanner/TWAIN interface to allow continuous scanning and appending of pages to scanned docs (you'd have to scan them all as images and then fiddle with the compression settings and merge the lot manually or by batch), let alone allowing the creation of searchable PDFs, this program proved itself to be of little utility to me.  It might be fine for the casual user, but I really can't think up a practical application for that isn't offered for free (i.e., ""included"") by other mainstream software out there; and, if you want to create Acrobat docs with the methods one is used to, you really just need to step up to Acrobat.  I know that's a pricey gambit for such aging software, but, that's why Adobe still has a corner on the market, like it or not....",I'm a big fiddle here and this is how I got started selling this plug-in.

I am so happy to say this is a huge improvement. First, it's much easier to navigate than previous versions. It seamlessly integrates between the software and internet content. Before, it would navigate me to the web for a document, or a branch of the family tree, but I would have trouble getting back to where I started in the software. Now, back buttons and a common menu make it simple.

I like that it's intuitive. I can figure a lot of it out without a manual. Huge improvement! And if you're someone who needs a little more guidance, it comes with a handy PRINT copy of a manual. Yes, that's a print copy, not an eBook. This means you can flip through, mark pages, and have it open on your desk as you work. The manual shows how you can take your family tree info, integrate photos and media from online, add stories, and then create a book that you can order about your family.

I love how this version syncs with online records. When you click the little leaf by a family member's name, you'll find immigration records (scanned images of hand written documents), maps, photos, census records and more. With a click of a button, you can associate a media file with a family member so that you can open it again later.

Since I am working from older versions of the program, I had to import my files. With this new version, you'll have to follow the steps to import it and convert to the new version. You'll have the option of saving a second copy in the old version at this time too, just in case you have two versions running on two computers or something.

The 2014 version allows you to choose your family tree view and there are shortcuts in a list format to each person in the family tree. It's so much easier to click and edit a family member in this version. It's also easy to add notes about the person and view additional resources.

If you're starting from scratch researching your family tree, you don't necessarily have to know all of your family history. If other family members have done some research, even distant family, you can link up to the existing records. I was able to find all of my family through at least great grandparents, and more in more cases. If you know birth dates, you can match up with records of family members that are already in the database and quickly fill out your family tree.

I give this four stars for ease of use. I would give it five if it didn't require a subscription to the service in order to be able to use the software.

I installed Internet Security 2012 onto my computer by downloading the trial version from the Kaspersky website and then entering the serial number that I had received with my purchase from Amazon.  The license is for three machines.  The clock starts ticking on the license the day that you install Kaspersky Internet Security on the first machine.  Installations on additional machines will expire on the same day as the first machine.

At the end of the installation, you are asked if you would like to participate in the Kaspersky Security Network  This is also referred to as Cloud Protection.  If you opt into this protection, any suspicious or unrecognizable data which is encountered by Kaspersky Internet Security on your computer is automatically sent via the internet to Kaspersky for analysis.  Since the same applies to everyone who has opted into Cloud Protection, Kaspersky claims that they can quickly detect new threats which makes Cloud Protection better for everyone.

I am running Kaspersky Internet Security on a laptop running Windows 7 Ultimate with an Intel Core i7-2720QM processor with 8 GB of RAM and on a netbook running Windows XP with a Intel Atom 1.6 Ghz processor and 2 GB of RAM.  The netbook has about 10 GB of free space on the hard drive.  I don't notice any appreciable lag in the computing time of either machine as compared to Norton Internet Security, for example.  Nor have I noticed the lag that the prior version of Kaspersky Internet Security caused on my machines during startup.

The interface for Kaspersky Internet Security is nice and uncluttered.  The opening page has only four buttons:  scan, update, parental control and tools.  At the top are buttons for reports and settings.  However creating scheduled scans is not a straightforward as it should be.  You must go under tools / settings, then click on full scan settings, then click on a button that reads ""run mode"".  Why couldn't Kaspersky just put a button that read ""schedule scans""?

A scan of the 750 MB hard drive of my laptop using the standard settings takes several hours.  Reports about the events such as banners that were blocked, scans that were performed and applications that were controlled.  This level of detail in the report may not be needed, but it is nice that it is available if you want to see what Kaspersky Internet Security has been doing.

Some nice features of the scan settings include the ability to set rules for computers which are used for gaming or which run programs which require a lot of resources.  In the case of gaming, there is a specific gaming profile which when set, disables updates and scheduled tasks.  You can also set the software to postpone scheduled tasks in the case of a high load on the CPU.

A nice scan feature is the Vulnerabilities Scan which scans for outdated versions of the software on your computer.  This scan found outdated versions of Firefox, Java and even Photoshop on my computer.  The scan also found vulnerabilities on my computer such as allowing autorun on usb drives or problems with Internet Explorer.  In each case, I was given an internet link to a page which described the problem and the fixes.  In my opinion, this is a very important part of the scan since vulnerabilities in Java or Flash, for example could compromise the security of your computer.  I have been impressed by how quickly Kaspersky Internet Security picks up on problems with the software on my machine.  Thanks to Kaspersky, I often update my software long before I am asked to do so by the software packages themselves.  However, the protection is not without problems.  Even after I update Java, for example, the Vulnerabilities Scan still asks me to update even though I have already installed the version that Kaspersky is requesting.  This problem existed in prior versions of Kaspersky Internet Security as well and I would have liked to have seen Kaspersky correct it by now.

Other nice features include: safe run for applications which allows you to run unknown applications in a safe environment that is isolated from the operating system, Kaspersky Rescue Disk which creates a bootable CD or USB flash drive for eliminating infections and Privacy Cleaner which deletes cookies, logs and other private data.

You have the option of allowing Kaspersky Internet Security to check for updates automatically to manually check for updates.  The documentation with Kaspersky Internet Security indicates that it would be preferred if you let the program update automatically.  However, I have chosen to update manually.  Kaspersky Internet Security gives me warnings every day that updates are not automatic.  I also get warnings if my databases are more than 24 hours out of date.  I would have preferred at least a 2 or 3 day lag before I got these warnings and it is as if Kaspersky Internet Security is trying to nag me to choose automatic updates which I find annoying.

The features of Kaspersky PURE that Kaspersky Internet Security lacks include a more robust identity protection, a password manager, a disaster recovery option where data is backed up online, a more robust computer tune up and a more robust network security.  Although all of those features are nice, if you are just looking to protect your computer itself and don't want or need the features such as password manager, Internet Security is a more cost effective option than PURE.

In summary:
Cons:
- Scheduling scans is not intuitive.  You need to click on a button marked manual to change the virus scans from manual to scheduled and unless you know to click on the button.  Kaspersky should have made it much easier to schedule a virus scan.
- I had to change the default setting to allow for the full scan of USB drives when they are fist detected.  I strongly believe that full scans of USB drives should be the default setting with the allowance that the user can change the setting.  The only time that Kaspersky has found viruses during its scans is when I have plugged in a USB drive that I have used them to get data from someone else's computer.
- Open Vulnerabilities Scan not part of the full scan
-  The Open Vulnerabilities Scan does not recognize when programs with vulnerabilities are updated to the latest version.
-  Nags when the databases are only a day old

Pluses
- Not intrusive on your computer's performance
- Updates even when the network speed is slow

(I did have back-ups of my data and photographs - so I only lost two days work fixing things.)

I'm not going to go into all the details of this program.  Others have covered this better than I could.  I just want to make it known that I think Kaspersky simply is the safest and best, and I wouldn't surf any website without the latest update.  Kaspersky Internet Security 2011 is as it says on the box: ""Everything You Need to Stay Safe.""

Just one more thing: I also use Windows Washer to get crap off my computers and keep them running full speed.  Kaspersky programs don't bother with Internet clutter or other non-threats, and neither do the other security programs.

I have been using this software on and off for about two months.  I really wanted to hold my review until I had finished the software.  I wanted to be able to tell potential buyers how far this package, alone, had gotten me toward becoming an actual speaker of Spanish.

However, it has become clear to me i will never finish reviewing this software.  i don't have a truly compelling reason to learn spanish and without that i find that my motivation has simply failed 2/3rds of the way into set 1 of 3.  I suppose one could wonder if my boredom with the software is a sign of a weakness in its design.  it is a question I've asked myself many times. Yes, the lessons are repetitive but they probably NEED to be.

So far the key strength of the program has been to teach me new spanish words.  The program itself never translates anything into English so you wind up ""thinking"" in Spanish.  This is what they mean by immersion.  However, as i have gone through chapter after chapter i have found my ability to form sentences not improving at all.  This has caused me to become discouraged.  I really think that the people at Rosetta Stone should include some early confidence builders that drill making the user get whole sentences correct as much as they drill individual words and parts of words.  I know that is jumping ahead but it would have helped to hold my interest.

If I do get back to it I will, of course, revise my review.  I subtracted a star because the voice recognition portion of the program is not very good.  Even when I bumped up the level on the voice recognition it still accepted as correct words I had intentionally pronounced incorrectly.  It is, however, clear to me that this is a rigorous and serious software package that truly attempts to TEACH you to read AND write Spanish.","I have many questions about this program.

If you like Ultra, but want to be able to have more control over color and audiomixing this version gives you that added functionality.  I have used a lot of different video editing packages, but this one has it all from special effects to titles and onboard DVD authoring and web sharing.  It is light on system resources even when editing high definition and very stable.  I experienced no crashes while using this software, which is more than I can say for some of it's competiors.  If you wish to add more professional flair to your productions, especially if you do music vidoes then the added modules definitely are something you'd be interested in.  If having that many options and that much control doesn't interest you, you might want to start with one of the other version--but this is a software you can grow into as your skills grown.  I highly reccomend it.

I like to play around with photos, but would like to gradually learn more about how to take better pictures, and how to edit them afterward.  AfterShot Pro is the perfect fit for me.  This is not the software you would use to make pixel-level edits but, rather, it is for doing overall fine tuning of a photo's color, sharpness, tone, etc.  In other words, if you need to erase an object from a photo, use something else (Corel PhotoPaint, Adobe Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, and others).  But if you need to darken a picture, accentuate the shadows, crop, tilt, etc. then this is a very easy-to-use tool.

Here are a few highlights for me:
1) Play around all you want...your original photo never gets changed.  AfterShot Pro lets you find a photo and start tinkering with it right away.  It might feel as though you are messing around with your original, but the truth is that all changes get made to a copy.  Basically, you can create and manage multiple versions of a photo without every needing to worry that you've ruined something.

2) Lots of presets that get jobs done quickly.  For example, some of the default presets are ""Bluer Skies"" and ""Deeper Shadows"".

3) You can make a sequence of modifications to one photo, and then copy and apply that same sequence to other photos.  You can even save those steps as your own preset, if you think you'll need them again someday.  For example, suppose you take a lot of daytime beach photos.  After looking at your photos, you realize that in most of them, the color of the sand looks washed out.  Well, make all the adjustments you need to one of your beach shots, and then simply apply those adjustments to the rest of the photos that have the same problems.

4) Lots of advanced features that will be there for me if I move beyond ""amateur"":  For example, there is a ""Lens Correction"" tool that lets me browse through a database of hundreds of SLR lenses to find the one I used for a picture, and it will make small (to me, nearly imperceptible) adjustments to a photo, based on the known distortion that lens exhibits.

5) Quick access to documentation.  Though AfterShot Pro doesn't come with a printed manual, its online documentation is well organized, helpful, and immediately accessible from the program's help menu.

Recently, I saw that there was a good price on Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom 4 (comparable, though not identical to AfterShot Pro in its features, and typically much more expensive).  I was tempted to buy it, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I'm really quite happy with all that I can do with AfterShot Pro.  I believe both programs have trial versions that allow you to test them out for a limited time, so you can compare for yourself.  But at roughly half the cost of Lightroom, Corel's AfterShot Pro is perfect for me!","I was really disappointed that Avon discontinued this program because it's so powerful and versatile. I had never used anything without it, even on a large scale. Sadly, I cannot find it at this level. It is so powerful"

Many security vendors continued to make improvements on the resource usages every year.  Trend Micro was getting worse with the initial load time. The load time for the security suite 2007 was too slow for my taste.

I figured I would give the 2009 version another chance. Once again I am not impressed with install and load times. The install too long because the update process, The load time after reboot continue to be a drag. Once loaded Trend Micro does NOT take a large amount of system resources and the scan time are fairly quick. However; I have decide to uninstall it and use other product because of the initial load time / update process.

The pro version is packed with many features, including my favorite the keystoke encryprtion. This will prevent any software application from stealing information as you type.

I would recommend the product for the protection value, scan speed, and the small load on the system resources and if you do not mind the initial load time then you will be completely satisfied. I just hate slower boot times. There are better products out there when it comes to preventing spyware/malware, so I recommend just using an additional anti-spyware program to overcome that.

Compared to the old McAfee, Norton tasks system resources much more than it should. So when I was offered a copy of McAfee Total Protection 2012 for review, it seemed like a no-brainer for me and I jumped at the chance.

Three months later, I am uninstalling it on each of the three computers I installed it on and moving back to Comcast's Norton, forfeiting the remaining nine months of the McAfee subscription.

I installed it on a desktop PC running Windows Vista x86, a laptop running Windows Vista x64, and a netbook running Windows XP. I was able to install McAfee on the two Windows Vista machines without issue, but I believe I have only had Norton on them since the last time I reformatted each of those machines. The Windows XP Netbook installed OK, but McAfee wouldn't activate properly. It seems that the old Comcast-branded version of McAfee I had removed a few years ago left some remnants in the registry that made it extremely difficult to activate that PC. McAfee thought I was still using that old Comcast version and said the subscription had expired. It took numerous uninstalls and reinstalls to finally get it activated properly, deactivating and reactivating the license at the McAfee site each time, and switching the order of those tasks each time until I stumbled onto the right combination.

Any satisfaction I felt at finally getting McAfee successfully activated was shortlived, however. The Windows XP machine began producing nightly errors on the McAfee program, and for a good hour before the error, the computer became extremely unresponsive.

Not only that, but all three computers frequently reported that McAfee real-time scanning had been disabled. Although I was able to enable real-time scanning again, it would only last a day or so, making any protection McAfee might offer extremely unreliable.

I am sorry to say that McAfee is no longer a product I would recommend to anyone - especially anyone not very computer savvy. I work in IT, and I found it cumbersome and frustrating. Your malware protection should be something that, while still needing periodic checks, just works without constant manipulation. That is not true of this iteration of McAfee. For now, I'm installing Comcast's Norton again. It may use more system resources than I like, but at least it works. I will be trying Kaspersky or another competitor in the near future, though.","I was using thisbundle to remove the malicious software that was already there.

This is the format my digital video camera produces in HD, and very few applications were supporting it when I purchased this program.

I've never had it hang or crash on me.  The only draback is that it likes to take over displaying every image, quick time, windows media and other file types if you let it.  Just don't let it.

Otherwise, burning CD's and DVD's is simple and easy with Nero.  Upgrades and updates always keep you on top of new stuff.

My other specific use was to design my backyard (landscaping, patio and walkways).

This is the only home design software I've ever used, so I cannot compare this to other programs.  Out of the box, the software is easy to install, but, for me, is not intuitive.  I had to go to the tutorials and spend time learning and practice drawing.  It would have been nice if the software came with a hard copy ""basic"" user guide so that I didn't have to flip from tutorial & back to my drawing(s).

I was able to draw my floor plan fairly quickly and am pleased with the way it came out.  I'm still tweaking my backyard plan, which is proving to be a little more difficult to create because it is a freestyle design that I create (and delete) as I go.

My overall impression of this software is positive, and it is possible for a novice to pick up and learn with the help of the Chief Architect tutorials.  My main complaint is that the software should come with a hard copy basic guide so that you can draw and look something up without having to look for instructions/help online (the back & forth).","I was excited to get this software because it's so easy to use.

The assumption is that you are building your own machine and looking to put Windows 8 on a from-scratch install, but this is still a multi-boot friendly OS and if your intention instead is to install a full copy of Windows 8 without upgrading your current system, well, that works too:  you can put this on old hardware so long as your machine meets the system requirements.  There has been some confusion at the lack of an 'OEM' SKU for Windows, so I suspect that until we hear otherwise, this is our 'OEM' substitute for those of us who like to tinker with hardware.

If you're considering Windows 8, there are benefits many small and large. The patchwork way in which the OS seems to meld old into new can be confusing, and it's clear the UI pays lip service to mice while eagerly awaiting your first touch-screen or touch-pad purchase. But to give credit where credit is due, there are benefits under the surface to go with the drawbacks you see before your eyes. Putting Windows 8 Pro on a new system is a good hedge against longevity, but will require experienced Windows 7 (and below) users to be patient with the newer parts of the UI.

This version of Windows 8 is different from Windows 8 Pro in that it does not allow you to use Remote Desktop or BitLocker hard drive encryption, nor can you join the machine to an Active Directory Domain.  There are several native Windows 8 apps included with all versions of Windows 8:  News, Stocks, Weather, Pictures, E-mail, Music, Xbox integration (to your XBox account, to view your stats or stream content to/from your PC), and Facebook.  There is also support for Windows SkyDrive and a Windows Live account, to the point that your PC's user account can be fully integrated with your Windows Live account if that is what you wish.  While Windows Media Center is listed as requiring a separate license, right now Microsoft is offering that license for free on the Windows 8 website (Amazon won't let me put external links here or I would).

The biggest change in Windows 8 is that the Start Menu that we have had since Windows 95 is no longer a menu. It is a full-screen splash of square tiles instead of icons, which vary in width from one to two tiles wide. Some of this makes sense in that some of today's programs are more like the Windows Desktop Gadgets we've seen in Vista and 7: they sit idle, stream information and need to be big enough to be readable. Although this is the biggest visual change, if you've used Windows Media Center, Office 2010, or an XBox 360, you've already been interacting with similar interfaces. This sort of UI has been slowly making its way into Microsoft's products for a while now.

That said, the transition from the familiar Start Menu to the full-screen splash takes some getting used to. It may take some arranging to get the tiles laid out conveniently, but Microsoft makes this easy to do. The rest of the Windows 8 OS spends its time hopping between the old and the new look. The desktop looks exactly like it did in Windows 7 and Vista, except there's no Start Button: you're expected to press the Windows key or move your mouse to the bottom corner of the screen to launch the tile dashboard.  The desktop looks exactly as it did in 7, only without the Start Button. All programs can be launched directly off the tile screen, and while Windows 8 apps run one at a time in a full-screen view, older programs run from within the Desktop and can be resized. We have a version of Internet Explorer 10 accessible from the desktop that looks just like IE 9 did in Windows 7, then we have a version of Internet Explorer 10 in the tile screen that looks entirely different.  Windows 8 applications don't really ""close"" any more:  when you leave an application, it just disappears from view, like a smartphone OS would do. Some parts of the Control Panel have the tile look and feel and the options cascade left-to-right like the Home screen in Office 2010. Other parts of the Control Panel look exactly like they did in Windows 7 and before.

Windows 8 may appear to be a patchwork of old and new, but there's more going on under the covers. In earlier versions of Windows, the number of programs running in the background could get unwieldy and slow things down. There was a shift to rely more on Services, which are listeners that sit idle waiting to launch programs only when needed. Windows 7 started to get bogged down with a lot of running Services though, and so Microsoft have stripped several services out of Windows 8, which means Windows 8 runs more efficiently than Windows 7. Any machine that can run 7 can run 8 (and I remember installing 7 on some pretty old hardware!).

Where older versions of Windows would have to re-launch a program every time it is opened, in Windows 8 anything not being used by you is set aside and the resources it used handed back to the OS for other work.  Programs respond much faster on relaunch due to having been left in this standby mode. The Windows Vista and 7 ""Aero effects"" that gave your windows a glassy sheen and rounded corners used graphics and CPU to run, so they've been stripped out in favor of simple color schemes, a bit of glassiness at the Desktop, and blocky corners. Interaction with Windows in the Tile UI is easier if you have a touchscreen or you're using a tablet, and if you're a Windows Phone user the territory is already pretty familiar. The downside for me has been that I don't have a touchscreen, and so I spend a lot of time hunting along the edges of the screen for scrollbars and dragging around to be able to interact with everything. My chief complaint with the UI hasn't been with the Tile dashboard so much as it's been that the scroll bars are too skinny and at times I have to hunt for them.

Ultimately, time will tell whether people adjust to Windows 8 or long for the familiar.  I've found the IE 10 browser on the Tile side to be less compatible and more cranky with websites, but I expect that to change given time. I like the fact that antivirus and security are rolled into the OS without me having to take care of them or be interrupted with update notifications. The OS runs updates on a schedule that's far less aggressive than previous versions and thus far hasn't forced me into a reboot, and Microsoft has partnered with Adobe to roll their updates into Windows--no more random and frequent Adobe update nags. I've been told that the performance for gaming is supposed to be greater simply by virtue of a cleaner codebase, but I haven't seen anything substantially different apart from faster boot-up and shut-down times.  Gamers remember that you're also at the mercy of the game-maker--just as we've been with any OS release. The basic applications like Weather, Photos, Stocks, Mail, and more are very user-friendly, but solely within the context of the new look & feel:  expect little familar ground and a lot of new territory.

UPDATE:  Amazon customer Robert Haines points out (in the comments) that a program called Classic Shell will remove the Tiles interface and restore the 'classic' Start Menu.  There is also a program called Pokki that will let you customize your own UI.  A. Humphries also gives us a link in the comments below showing Stardock's product ""Start8"" and some good feedback on how it works.

UPDATE: Amazon customer AJ points out that although Windows 8 Pro may in the future require you to purchase a license for Windows Media Center separately, right now you can get a serial key for free via the Windows 8 site: just go to the Windows 8 ""Add Ons"" section. You may request up to 5 serial keys using different e-mail addresses and Microsoft will e-mail them to you within 24-48 hours.

UPDATE, 11/2013:  Microsoft has now released Windows 8.1, a minor update to the OS that mostly attempts to make the user experience better.  If you purhcase this copy of Windows 8, you will be offered the ability to update it to 8.1 at no additional cost.  The upgrade is pushed through the Windows Store that is part of Windows 8.  Personally, I've done clean installs of 8.1 from the MSDN media and done an in-place upgrade via the store, on both my desktop and laptop, and have not had good experiences.  I don't personally recommend the update at this time for that reason.  Peraps with time it will get better.

This review was posted under the System Builder DVD product listing of Windows 8. The three versions of Windows 8 are this ""just Windows 8"" version (which is a bit like Windows Home in earlier versions), ""Windows 8 Pro"", and ""Windows 8 Enterprise"". The generic Windows 8 that replaces ""Home"" in earlier versions has the basic feature set. The ""Pro"" flavor adds the BitLocker drive encryption we previously had to buy Windows Ultimate to obtain. It adds the ability to use Remote Desktop (that in my opinion should be in all versions of Windows), and it makes it easier to connect your computer to an Active Directory Domain. Windows 8 Pro is best for the power user or the small business and most people hardware-savvy enough to build their own machines will most likely prefer the added control they gain from using Pro.  If I were building a system for a non-savvy family member I might go with this standard version of Windows 8 though:  the likelihood of needing drive encryption or remote desktop on a system that would mostly be used for documents and web surfing isn't much, and I certainly don't have family or friends running their own AD Domains. ""Enterprise"" takes things one step further by being designed for use in medium to large businesses with corporate networks. There is also a ""Windows 8 RT"", but this version is solely intended for the ARM processors and other hardware built-in to tablet computers and is not intended for a desktop or laptop computer.","I was excited to get the latest version of OpenBSD Pro and Mac OS X.

The program integrated straight into Vista and auto configured without me having to make any adjustments.

One of the issues I have is that despite Viruses and Spyware being a real threat, when you buy a new computer you don't get any really powerful programs to stop them.  Windows Defender works to a certain level but when you use a good program then you realize it is limited.

I like this software by Trend Micro, it isn't over the top with unnecessary buttons, and the interface is simply and easy to use.  It runs seamlessly in the background and you wouldn't even know it was there until it pops up occasionally to let you know if there is a problem.  You can set the parameters on how you want the program to run or just let it run as already configured.  You have the choice on whether to do a scan right away or let it do it automatically at a certain time.

As far as effectiveness, since 08/03/2009, the program has intercepted 41 threats.  Admittedly these were low level and internet cookies but it still reflects that the program is functioning to a good level.

For real artists it will be an extraordinary tool.  For other types of users there are probably better choices out there.

Some specific comments:

PHOTOSHOP

- Painter will take in Photoshop files, but isn't a replacement for Photoshop (or Paintshop Pro).  While it is possible to manipulate photos in Painter, the process isn't nearly as streamlined or versatile as in the other programs. The import process is also not perfect - among other things, text and path-edited shapes created in Photoshop are translated into non-editable bitmapped images, or are not brought in at all. For me that alone makes it a deal breaker as a Photoshop replacement.  I should note, however, that in addition to saving files as Photoshop files, Painter will also export files as Illustrator files, if you want to draw first and label later.

- Painter's own path- and vector-based editing functions are basic compared to Photoshop's, though I was happy to find that splines are supported.

- Painter will also take in Photoshop brush definitions, which is a win. While you can buy some additional Painter brush packs, they can't compare with the huge number of Photoshop brushes available online (including many that are free). I should note that the translations many need some tweaking, and that there are some other limitations.

HARDWARE

- If you don't have a pressure sensitive stylus you will lose much of the brush functionality. If your sole pointing device is a mouse, it's probably not worth buying this program.

- Every once in a while the program will hang temporarily while I'm using it. This is usually, though not always, associated with loading a new brush definition.  I should note that my system has a 2.16 GHz processor, and 4 gig of ram, which is slightly faster than the minimum recommended configuration.

BUGS

- Some newer features feel like they're not ready for prime time. For example, there are several different workspaces available, including one for small screens (good), but it appears that that workspace has lost the shape and vector functions in the side menu, and there is no pane you can pop up to get those back.  Huh?

- The docs also have some annoying entries. For example, under the heading ""To Build a 1-Rank Nozzle,""  you find: ""In a 1-Rank nozzle, the images do not need to be in one line... For more information, see To build a 2-Rank nozzle."" Under the heading ""To build a 2-Rank nozzle"" you then find ""To paint with your new nozzle file, youll need to load it first. For more information, see To load a 1-Rank nozzle file.""  (One advantage of online docs is that this may be fixed in a later upgrade).

PAINTER ESSENTIALS

There is also a lite version of Painter called Painter Essentials. This is entirely bitmap based: no objects, no paths, no vectors. It's a nice toy, but not really a low-budget alternative to Painter.  (And speaking of toys, I really wish Corel would spend resources on its docs and UI, and not on things like audio brushes).

PROS

So why get this program?  Well, the actual painting features are amazing.  Hundreds of brushes, a clone function that can be set up to work like tracing paper, watercolor emulation that includes things like variable paper bleed, several different perspective grids, and other things I'm sure I haven't found yet.  Can you fake this in other programs?  Yes, but Painter is designed to showcase and support them. The interaction is facile and natural.

So, if you were looking for a replacement for Photoshop, this isn't it. If you were looking for a replacement for canvas, palette, and easel? Might be.","I purchased this tool to help me with my painting. I had the opportunity to use it as a digital painter, but when I got older it became obsolete.

Overall, I like this software. It has most of the power of Adobe Photoshop without the high cost. The learning curve is also less steep.

I mostly use Adobe Photoshop Lightroom to catalog, touchup, and print my photos. Every once in a while, I need to perform more extensive editing and printing. For these times, I prefer to use Corel Paintshop Photo instead of Adobe Photoshop (Elements). Paintshop is easier to use and as effective for my image processing needs.

The 64-bit version loads relatively quickly. At least on my machine, it does not bring the system to a near halt like Lightroom. It does consume a lot of CPU resources when processing a photo, say during a One-Step Photo Fix operation, but other programs can still be used.",Everything about this is really nice for beginners who want to get started with software like Tivoli and Nutmeg. The only thing I dont know about is its cost. It is so great for learning the curve before you start printing.

The only problem I had was the State portion (which this software includes 1 state return) wanted to charge me $39.95 to download my state program! I had to do a search on the Turbo Tax site to find a contact number. I called, waited about 10 minutes, explained the situation, was told it was a glitch with the retail version of the software and thankfully a code was able to be given to me to ""unlock"" my one free state program while in the software. Once I got that info then it was easy to finish as usual. Just so you know, if you purchased the Federal + State, then you are entitled to one state return for free so if the software prompts you to pay for your one state download, stop and contact intuit. The only charge should be $19.95 to e-file your one state return (if you choose to e-file it) and you can e-file your federal return for free.","I had a problem with this portion of the software I purchased, so I purchased it without a problem.

Office 2003 gives you what you already have in Office XP (and a few earlier versions) so learning how to use it is never going to be a problem.  In virtually every way the program looks and feels like the previous Office versions.

There are improvements although I am not sure how much a home user will need the XML functionality.  It may be a god-send one day but today it is still not a major factor and certainly does not demand a major update.  The RESEARCH option is something to contend with and could be quite useful - it is almost like having Encarta loaded on your machine as well.  I found it a bit limiting though; it is good as a thesaurus but there is no world atlas, quotation source, etc.  Many people have applauded the new look and feel of Outlook.  Again, it behaves just the same as previous versions of Outlook did.

Microsoft chose to retire the Office bar and that is a big mistake.  They are trying to push the Quick Launch bar but most businesses and almost all Office users preferred the Office bar.

Don't get me wrong:  Office 2003 works very well and with Word, Outlook, Excel, Access and Publisher you can literally do anything!  It also preforms very well.  But, again, unless Microsoft starts making major changes, these releases should not be heralded as new.  If anything, they should be upgrades that former users should be able to download if they registered the original product - the cost is too prohibitive to justify upgrading.  And, as your Office 97 or XP works just as well, you should think seriously before spending the money.","I'm a big fan of this product and I'm sure it will too. I bought it before I started using it.

I have used Photoshop a lot but never used a work flow package other than iPhoto, so despite understanding the concepts of workflow I have not had any practical experience using any tool like Lightroom.  So out of the box this was a little intimidating to use.

Setup/installation - This worked great other than having to update my Mac OS to 10.9 to get it to install.  Once the OS was up to date, the actual installation was very quick, just a few minutes.

Starting Use - Here things got a little hairier.  Much like Photoshop, there are lots of options, likely many that an individual will never use.  The tool icons are familiar, but took a while to get the gyst and some old digital images imported.  Immediately the things I like are the ability to change the white balance of batched photos.  I batched a series of images of Marmots and Ground Squirrels in Alaska and took them from worthless to perfect in no time (if you subtract the time it took me to figure out how to get them all batch selected and then converted.

HDR - I was also excited to see that HDR is built in.  I have long played with Photomatix's trial version but have been afraid to pull the trigger.  Also, I have used the Photoshop plug in and this built in option is more like the plug in and less dynamic than Photomatix.  Or at least with my current abilities.  I can get it to make decent HDR images again testing with Alaskan images of glaciers, but I cannot get that unworldly look.  Not sure if that is me, or not in the abilities of this software. But I was able to get highlights on the ice as well as details in underbrush so that is success.

Other things - It does look like there is a learning curve and I am still early in the process.  I have many photos from over the years and hope to shoot some to start populating catalogs and seeing how this affects my work flow.  I'm looking forward to trying more batch corrections and occasional clean up with the editing tools.

All of the PCs run Win 7 (64). On this PC I am writing from, the installation went super easily. I was able to turn off features I did not want. On my wife's PC the installation was significantly more problematic. I could not turn off some of the features and it would put her PC into a restart loop. She did not have a virus. I had just built the PC with a fresh HD. Eventually I had to remove it and use another AV suite. Other than that little problem this software as an anti virus is fantastic.

I chose not to use the other internet paranoia software included because it slowed down my internet browsing or game playing. It would lock out some popular MMOs and not let me log in to the server. Disabling the windows firewall, selecting allow program and so on would still not let me play. I have intentionally downloaded a virus laden file to check it (it was packed as a .rar). Once the file was unpacked AVG caught the virus and put it into quarantine.

Pros:
+ Anti Virus portion of the program is really good
+ Nice desktop widget
+ Fairly unobtrusive in AV mode only

Cons:
- The internet security portion is sometimes impossible to turn off (difficult to find).
- Seems to block software you want to use, even selecting - Allow -.

Summary:
So for a great antivirus, get AVG antivirus. If you think you may have to have everything you do on the web then this may be for you.","I'm a big fan of the pcI server, and I haven't had to use any antivirus programs to run my wife crazy about this virus. I got online and ran my own pci and tried"

You can edit pictures, edit videos, create photo slideshows for a photo montage, burn CDs/DVDs, etc. Let's go a little bit more in depth on the software itself.

Installation - Installation was very easy. If you have conflicting software, i.e. another Roxio program that has similar features, such as a burner, then it will ask you if it's OK to uninstall it. And the only way to install it is if you let it uninstall the previous software. Unfortunately, it does not tell you what the conflicting software is so this is only going on assumption. It's really just clicking on OK and next and the software is installed. Keeping in mind that before you can really use the software, you need to restart your computer.

Usage - Burning CDs/DVDs is easy with this. When you put a disc in, it is instantly recognized by the software and you are able to burn it from the quick launch if you would like. I have also put two pictures side by side and that was easy to do once you figure it out. I didn't find anything in the picture editing software that allows a cutout so you can take an object and make the background transparent so it is a little bit lacking if you're really looking for a comprehensive picture editing tool. The video editor is also easy to use. You can locate videos and pictures you want to put in there. You're even able to flip videos clockwise/counter-clockwise, an especially useful feature if you are like me and use the iPhone for some video capture and when it gets put on the computer, it's not rotated properly. Overall, the features are pretty straightforward. It isn't going to be extremely advanced but for a simple novice or if you're just needing this for simple adjustments, it works great.

Performance - This is where I had to take stars off for this. It seems to have slowed my computer down a bit so starting up takes a little bit longer. Another issue I have noticed is that when I was exporting my video project, it froze the program a while before it would allow you to export it. My other gripe is that right after installing it, my computer suddenly crashed for no reason. This only happened once but I have to blame this software since I have never seen my computer do that before. It could just be that you need an extremely new computer to run this software but if that's the case, Roxio is a little bit short-sighted as not everyone can upgrade their computer every 2 years or so.

Overall, it does come with a lot of features. All of the things you can do with this program is a bit intermediate level and not really for an advanced user who is relying on this for state of the art photo editing or movie making. It also seem to have a bit of performance issues so hopefully Roxio fixes this in future products.","I use this program mostly for personal use. I used it for research and development purposes.

This is not necessarily a bad thing, as some of the products in 360 are (in my opinion) ""fluff"" and might well get in the way of running a small business efficiently. From the standpoint of pricing, you're looking at $20 per device (with the surprisingly weak mobile apps counting as a device). For a small business with 10 or fewer desktops, this isn't a bad deal, though it's not a great one either.

The installation went off without a hitch, but I would have liked to have been given a clearer indication of when I could choose which of the products were installed.

My primary use of Office 2010 is Outlook, followed by Word and Excel. Probably the best thing that can be said about Office 2010 from an upgrader's perspective is that it installed easily and it isn't a major revision to the software. However, for someone paying list price for this software title, I haven't found much reason for someone that owns the same applications of the 2007 variety to upgrade.

The interfaces of each program have been fine-tuned, and perhaps some functionality here and there is better than it used to be. However, for those of us that want to use our products to get our work done, the differences that might number in the hundreds during an exhaustive review just don't make themselves obvious.

My biggest disappointment continues to be with Outlook. Spam is by far the most egregious problem facing anyone that uses E-Mail. It sucks your productivity away, embarrasses you when an important client correspondence gets shuffled into the spam folder, and is generally annoying.

Outlook's handling of spam hasn't changed since I first used Outlook 2003 so many years ago. It uses profiles that are updated periodically by Microsoft and white lists and black lists that you set up to determine the likelihood that an incoming message is spam. Back then, I found a much superior spam-fighting tool called SpamBayes that worked as a plug-in for Outlook and ran circles around Outlook's built-in solution by using Bayesian filtering to learn what constitutes spam that you receive. It got better as you used it, learning which messages were good and which were bad, and you could ""feed"" it both good and bad messages to help it learn faster.

After all this time, Microsoft still can't do spam filtering as good as that freeware effort by a couple of individuals. Unfortunately, an update to Outlook 2007 broke the ability for SpamBayes to operate correctly, so I had to stop using it. While writing this review, I decided to check to see if development has restarted on SpamBayes, and it appears that it has, which is good news indeed!

If you are currently using Office 2007 with satisfaction, I see little need at this point to upgrade to 2010. If you need to move to Office, or buy another copy, Office 2010 seems to work much in the same way as 2010 and documents created in each seem to interoperate without any problem.

If Microsoft had just improved their spam filtering in Outlook, that would be worth the upgrade price all by itself. Spam is that big of a problem, and the cost of the package would be outweighed by the time it would save those of us who have to deal with it every day of our lives.

Besides some small tweaks, where is the innovation, Microsoft?

For those that have not gone down the Microsoft Office path and are locked into its solutions, you would do well to look into the many open source and free options that are available.

Google's GMail is excellent at spam filtering, and its interface is pretty good. It's not completely up to the integration of Outlook, but it's getting close, and the world is moving to cloud-based computing with blinding speed. Having all your E-Mail available to you from anywhere is very spoiling, and it makes using a PC-based client like Outlook seem perfectly archaic by comparison.

I have not explored the other solutions, such as Google Docs for doing written documents and spreadsheets, but the little bit of time I've spent with them show them to be useful for all but the power users in many situations.

Microsoft needs to innovate to keep up. Maybe Office 2010 is the foundation that gets Office mostly right, and now they can use that foundation to start innovating again. Maybe. If they don't, they will be passed by, and people will look back at the last couple of decades and say ""remember when we used to have to use Outlook for E-Mail? Remember trying to do a mail merge in Word - yikes!""

All that said, if you need Office, you need it. The best that I can say is that it doesn't seem to be much different from Office 2007, which wasn't all that different from Office 2003. Whether you need to spend this kind of money on the functionality it provides is completely up to you.",I was disappointed that Atari discontinued the upgrader because I didn't like it at all.

And if you created the video files in the first place, the tool you used should be able to do that for you, so I'm not sure you truly need a tool like Crunch.
==================================
The misleading description was actually a real issue for me. I do understand the concept of copy protection, but I was also going by the description given to the product. If you do not own an iPod that can display video, this is not a useful tool. My understanding from the description of the product was that I'd be able to ""convert your movies and shows"" but when they say ""your movie"" they don't mean DVDs that you purchased but would like to watch on your iPod.

I wanted this product to put a couple of kids movies on my husband's iPhone so my son could watch them on long car rides, but you can't use it to crunch copy protected (i.e. store bought) DVDs.  I guess I don't understand how my paying retail price for a DVD doesn't allow me to put the movie onto my iPod. To be clear, I don't blame Roxio for this problem, but I do blame them for not being clearer about the limitations in the description.

The interface was easy to use, and it did work well on a movie I'd shot with my own video camera (AVI), but that was just not what I'd hoped to use it for, as I have very little need to watch those videos on my iPod.",Update: I got this product to help my family with their 3rd car in South Carolina and I couldn't pass it without them!

But everyone knows Amazon's rating system is utterly subjective -- and for me, this one failing on the part of Quicken Deluxe 2011 is extremely annoying and devastating.

I had been using Money 2006 for several years.  As everyone knows, that product line was discontinued due to lack of demand.  I decided to get Quicken Deluxe 2011, which promised Money file compatibility.  While waiting for Quicken to arrive from Amazon, I uninstalled Money 2006 to reclaim some disk space.

To my great distress, I discovered, upon launching Quicken, that Money must be present on the system for Quicken to import the Money file!  According to the dialog box, ""Microsoft Money 2007 or 2008 must be installed on your computer before we can import your Money file.""  Okay, so maybe Money 2006 wouldn't even have worked, so it probably wouldn't have made a difference in my case.  But this is just absolutely ridiculous.  My Money file has no password protection, and I just don't see why Money is required to be installed for Quicken to read the file.

So I decided to give Quicken a spin anyway to see if it was worth my time to start from scratch.  When I clicked on that big ""Get Started"" button, Quicken started downloading an updated financial institution list.  After 10 minutes, it was still doing the same (the status indicator was simply moronic and indicated little).  I stopped out of that, and clicked ""Get Started"" again, this time Quicken began downloading a program update, but then nothing happened.  At this point, I decided to write up this review.

One other thing I also noticed is, after I ran Quicken for the first time, my quad-core PC, which had always been zippy and extremely responsive in everything, has begun to show some random slowdowns, which reminded me of the days when I ran Symantec's awful Norton Anti-Virus software.  I really wonder if Intuit installed some background services that have a significantly negative impact on my otherwise optimized system (Win 7 64-bit).

They're so easy to get immersed in, with hours of fun and detective work being spent playing them. ""Danger on Deception Island"" continues this great series on a wonderful route, and continues to be one of the best Nancy Drew games released to this date.

Nancy's friends Bess and George have arranged a vacation for her. Nancy will be staying with Katie Firestone, a marine biologist friend of George's, in Snake Horse Harbor, Deception Island (one of the San Juan Islands off the cost of Washington state). Nancy is immediately greeted by Katie, who was just getting back to her houseboat from getting groceries. When the two make it back to the boat, they discover that it's been ransacked and vandalized. Could this be the latest work done by an unknown group that's been robbing shops around town? Not only that, but an orphaned killer whale has recently made home in the harbor surrounding the town, and seems to be hanging around all by itself for no apparent reason.  Just who did this to Katie? Who are these vandals and robbers? And what's the real deal with this orca? It's now up to Nancy to submerge herself into the dangers surrounding Snake Horse Harbor to find the truth...

""Danger on Deception Island"" employs amazing graphics. Even though this game is a bit older, several of the graphics in this game could rival those used in games today. The suspects look so realistic that they almost look like actual actors and actresses. The graphics seen while kayaking, exploring the town, and walking on the beaches are nothing short of beautiful. Some real (or at least, realistic) photos of sea life are also presented throughout game play, which is a definite bonus. I felt like I was actually walking through a town by the beach while playing this game, instead of just playing a game featuring one.

""Danger on Deception Island"" has some of the best mini games, puzzles, and challenges that had been seen in Nancy Drew games upon its release. I especially enjoyed the mini games in Whale World (one of the explorable areas in the game). However, are several ways to die multiple times in this game (which doesn't bother me, but does some others), and one of the puzzles that involves getting a set of coordinates is very challenging and time-consuming. Aside from that puzzle, I can't complain at all.

All of the characters had their quirks, but they were a pretty well-casted bunch. Every suspect fit the story rather nicely, and they all had moments when they looked like they could be the culprit. The culprit becomes rather shocking, as there are several clues that come up and point toward another character(s) at the end of the game, until the ultimate truth is revealed. I could hardly wrap my mind around the fact that this character was the guilty party, but it was definitely a very tasteful twist (though I still would've slightly preferred the culprit being somebody else).

The first suspect met is Katie Firestone, who's a friend of George's and a marine biologist. She's pretty strong-willed, and definitely has some secrets that she's hiding from Nancy. Holt Scotto is an elderly fisherman who's running for harbor master, and doesn't particularly like Katie's defense of a policy that forces boats to stay several feet away from the whale (as he has to take the long way to get out to sea). Jenna Deblin is the owner of the Hot Kettle Caf, and thinks Katie has a lot of secrets as to what she truly wants to do with the whale (i.e. study it instead of help it). Andy Jason is the owner of Whale World, a tourist attraction that specializes in educating visitors in facts about whales, and wants Katie to sell out to him.

What really made the characters awesome was dialogue shared between Nancy and her phone friends. The conversations had with Bess and George and Frank and Joe Hardy were all very nicely scripted. Not a single one ever felt boring. The one-time phone friends were pretty memorable in their own ways too, such as Casey Porterfield (who constantly has a hard time understanding Nancy) and Hilda Swenson (she's so... well, I'll let you find out for yourself). The phone friends in this game were much better than the phone friends in several games were, and I would definitely like to see some of the one-timers make a second appearance.

The musical score in this game was awesome, which could be said about every single game created before it. However, this game does have a bit more going for it musically, as it definitely goes out of its way to make itself unique. The game features a lot of songs that sounded like they belonged in a movie about sailors, or from a kid's special to educate children about the seas and those who travel them. I felt like it went out of its way to make itself more ""beachy"" than other soundtracks have to make themselves ""scarier"" or more ""royal"". The realistic sounds of waves, seagulls, and seals made the music all the more fitting.

So, is Danger on Deception Island the best Nancy Drew game ever? I'd say it ranks among them. There are very few complains that I can make about this game, as nearly everything about it goes above and beyond. I would love to see Nancy re-visit Deception Island in a future case, as well as meet several of the characters she met here again. The game is *THAT* good!","I'm a big fisherman and I love this stuff. I'm a big fisherman, and I love that it's not so easy to get anywhere. My favorite is the San Diego Zoo, which has"

The package includes Vegas Pro 8 and DVD Architect Pro 4.5. (Update 1/3/2009: Vegas Pro 8 users can update to DVD Architect Pro 5 for free, providing Blu-Ray support).

We have produced over 20 instruction videos using Vegas (starting with Vegas 4) and could not be happier with the results. Every step from capturing the footage off our Mini-DV Canon GL2 Camcorder to authoring the master DVD is a smooth process.

Here are some general observations:

* The interface has a nice layout right out of the box, but is also easily customized to suite your personal editing habits
* The included plugins are top notch and compare nicely with some of the high dollar add ons for Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects
* Easier to use and learn than Adobe Premiere Pro
* Unlimited Video and Audio Tracks
* Great interactive tutorials are actually useful
* Great chromakey (greenscreen) functionality

I should probably point out right off the bat that the Streets and Trips 2009 does not include a GPS receiver. To make use of the GPS functionality, you would need to purchase a GPS receiver.

Installation
------------
(+) The program installed on Windows XP without a hitch.

(-) Streets & Trips does NOT include Pocket Streets, so you won't be able to use the program on your Windows Mobile Smart Phone or Pocket PC. Microsoft stopped including Pocket Streets for Windows Mobile starting in version 2008.

Data Entry
----------

o  Quick Manual Entry Method
You can omit the city and state information by simply entering the street and zip code. For example, you can enter 917 NW Harriman Street 97701 in lieu of 917 NW Harriman Street, Bend, OR 97701

o  Right-Click Method

Right click the map and on the menu select Route/Set as end. You can also select Set as end or Set as stop for setting the point as the start of the destination and for setting the point as a stop, respectively.

o  POI (Point of Interest) Method

Search for Points of Interest in the following categories (you can check off all the categories you want to conduct the search on):

Airlines, Attractions, Automotive, Bowling, Car Rental, Casual Dining,

Condos & Resorts, Cruise Lines, Dry Cleaning, Fine Dining, Golf, Grocery,

Health & Beauty, Home & Garden, Hotel, Informal & Carryout, Live Events,

Miscellaneous, Movies, Museums, Music/Books/Video, Retail, Services, Skiing,

Special Events, Sporting Events.

Next, specify the search radius in miles. You can display the search results alphabetically or by distance.

Map View
--------

(+)  Smooth and Responsive Zoom in/out and Dragging
You can very quickly zoom in and out of maps by using the scroll wheel. The map is also very responsive to zooming and mouse drags.

(-)  Bing Maps

Click on the icon on the toolbar to be directed to Bing maps in your browser for a satellite view of the map. Bing maps functions like a watered down version of Google maps. Maps are slow to load and there is no Street View like Google maps where you can zoom, rotate, pan through, or ""walk through"" street level *photos* of the maps.

Speech Engine
-------------

(+)  Street Names
The spoken directions not only give you the turn by turn directions but the street names as well. For example, it will give a direction like ""At 0.3 miles turn left onto Marysville Ave.""

(-)  Synthesized Voice

The female voice that gives directions is computer synthesized. Most of it is understandable, but just barely. Problems typical of speech engines (such as run-on words, choppiness, and whacky inflections) are especially pronounced. My Garmin and iGuidance GPS systems do a much better job of synthesized speech. Here are examples of a couple of glaringly bad mispronunciations: It improperly pronounces U.S. (as in highway US-50) as ""us."" It cuts off before finishes saying ""two"", so ""two"" sounds more like ""t-"" (the ""t"" consonant sound).

Miscellaneous
-------------

(+)  Construction Information Update

You can download construction information from the MapPoint site for an update of the latest road works. If your construction information is out of date, the software notifies you with ""The construction information for routes is out of date. Do you want to download a free update from the Microsoft MapPoint web service?"" Select Yes.

(+) Re-route

If you make a wrong turn, it will automatically recalculate a new route on-the-fly.

(+) Push-Pin and Other Customizations

You can use the push-pin to mark and annotate your own points of interest. You can draw on or highlight areas of the map free hand or with tools like the polygon tool and the line tool.

(+) Saved Trips

Each trip can be saved onto your hard drive as a .est file.

I'm disappointed that it does not include Pocket Streets for Windows Mobile. So, if you plan on using this program on-the-go, you would have to lug around your laptop.

Do not try to use Painter without a tablet - you'll be sorely disappointed.

I am pretty amazed at how Painter simulates analog brushes and strokes of all different varieties, and clearly you can create some very painterly or illustrative effects.

I am looking forward to using Painter with Photoshop files - something I haven't tried yet, but there are instructions for. The ability to pull in and use layered Photoshop files, seems stellar to me. How many times have you wanted an artistic effect in Photoshop that was just plain difficult to accomplish?

This is a very serious tool for serious artists. I know a lot of art directors and storyboard people who work 100% in Painter.

Some users have experienced reduced battery power (drains faster) after installing it.  I have experienced that but my husband did not.  We are both on macbooks.  My macbook is a year old and his is three years old. I ended up taking my machine into the genius bar.  Apple said iM was not snow leopard.  It said my battery was shot so it gave me a new battery, no charge. my machine has worked like a champ ever since and I still have snow leopard.

This is my original review before the above came to light.  The product remains five stars for me personally.

I am just discovering all the refinements which have gone into Snow Leopard.  However, what I want to comment on is the most important aspect to me.  I came to my Macbook from years of working on PCs.  One good thing PCs did for me was that I became quite a proficient little techie but that was because I was forced to do so.  I lost count of the amount of times I had to reinstall my operating system due to an overall system crash, an Internet Explorer flaw which crashed the whole OS, viruses or trojans or other problems which got past my virus protection software, etc., etc., When I went over to Mac, I was able to retire from being a self taught techie.  I have to do just about zilch on my macbook in order to keep it running well.  I have now used Tiger, Leopard and Snow Leopard.  Each one is an improvement over the last.  There is no bloating factor.  I don't have a bunch of extra software on here which I don't need.  In fact, I picked up about 18 GB of space by switching to Snow Leopard from Leopard.  Snow Leopard is working perfectly for me 24/7 and I have not really had to think about adapting to it.  It is so intuitive that I just find myself doing so automatically.

I always liked the finder and I like it even better now in Snow Leopard.  I've been doing great searches within my folders, getting wonderfully sized images as my thumbnails plus Quick Look is better than ever.  As I set all of my preferences for the whole OS, I discovered that certain things, which were more complicated to do in Leopard, are now simpler to do.  Some specs were removed entirely and macbook just does them quietly on its own in the background, which is fine by me.  I do not miss the hours I spent reading computer manuals as I tried to cope with being a PC user.

After the installation, everything still worked just fine.  I was able to just pick off where I had left off without missing a beat.  I have a David Pogue missing manual book sitting next to me but have yet to open it as I've run into no problems.

Best of all, it was really cheap to buy.  I've never had such a cheap OS yet it is so slick!!!!

It is hard for me to imagine why you would not want Snow Leopard on your Mac.  If I run into such a reason, I will come back and edit this review to include it!",I was really disappointed that AstraZene discontinued this product due to the size of the battery. It is so powerful that when you are using it you have to charge it for all the functions it is designed to do. My husband is

That said, I'm not a graphic designer, and test driving Corel's suite was much easier. Draw and PhotoPaint are very powerful and easy to use with great tutorial videos to get you started. The interfaces are very slick compared with CS4 and the software was extremely fast on a quad-core machine with two hard disks.

While I doubt Corel will unseat the dominant Adobe products for serious graphic designers, I'd recommend downloading the trial at least to see if you like the features. Some of the included software is a bit clunky (such as Website Creator) but there are about a dozen extra applications included in this package that may or not be useful, depending upon your needs. Overall, I think it's more intuitive that the Adobe suite so for my limited needs have found it very straightforward to use as an Adobe alternative.","I was at Camp Nou and was really sad when the software started crashing into my core.

I've also run both TurboTax and TaxCut during a few years to see if the ""help"" was better in one or the other (when I was trying to figure out how to answer a question).  Plugging numbers into these programs is not hard.  Determining what numbers to plug in can still be hard.

My experience is that the built-in help behind the questions for the Federal forms is usually OK.  In the unusual areas, I am surprised at how weak the help is - it's there, but not deep.  However, the help behind the State forms is not good - it's shallow at best.

The math in these programs is always right (usually... I did find a bug one year that they quickly fixed in an update), but again, the burden is on you the user to determine what numbers to plug in or when to say ""yes"" or ""no"" during the online interview that these take you through.  In many cases, it's not hard.  But in those hard(er) areas, it can take hours researching what is really being asked.  I've found myself downloading IRS forms and instructions most years to figure out at least one question, and I would not say that my tax returns are all that complicated (I don't have a lot of the odd situations to report).

Getting 5 Federal filings with the price of the full package this year was nice, but paying $19.99 to efile a State Form still feels ridiculously too much.  And in some cases, the Forms needed to file an odd-Sate return need to be paper (they aren't all included with TaxCut), so efile does not work in those situations.  I file 3 sets of forms each year (mine and for 2 of my kids) and this year, the cost or complexities with the kids' State forms will mean paper filing for both of their State returns.

I have not contacted H&R Block for help, so I can't comment on the waiting times to get that help or on the depth of help provided over the phone or over chat (however they do it).

But all of this is still a lot easier (and fun? at least it's a challenge to overcome) for the do-it-yourself type person, than the old paper forms or in taking all the papers to their office and paying them to do it (my opinion).",I used this program almost 3 years ago and it has been around for about 1 year.

This version is best suited for a company to apply to its employees' desktops, or for a home user who regularly uses their machine to connect to their company network.  This is the purpose for the Domain Join feature that is missing in Windows 7 Home:  most personal home networks are not architected and managed via Active Directory and a Domain Forest, for example.

While some home users may want to purchase Windows 7 Professional in order to use ""Windows XP Mode"", you should be advised that this mode will only operate on hardware that is new enough that it can support ""Virtualization Technology"":  without this requirement, you will not be able to use the ""Windows XP Mode"" feature.  Thankfully, Windows XP Mode is also not the same as ""XP Compatibility Mode"" - you can still use Compatibility Mode in all versions of Windows 7.  What XP Mode does is create a virtual machine that runs XP under the covers within your Windows 7 environment.  As a result, it is more recommended for cantankerous programs (say, running Office 2000) than it is for 3D gaming:  you are running a machine OS within a machine OS and this does affect performance.

The third feature added to Windows 7 Professional is the ability to make backups of your system.  This is a useful feature, especially for a business that has multiple users to manage--but for the home user this can also be done with free, easy-to-use tools such as Macrium Reflect.

Some very important things you need to know about upgrading:

1) There are two types of upgrade:  ""in-place"" (where a Vista machine upgrades to 7 and you get to keep all your programs) and ""clean"" (where you lose all your old programs and settings).
2) Anyone going from XP to 7 will have to go ""clean"".
3) Anyone going from a different Vista to 7 (for example, Vista Home up to 7 Pro, or Vista Ultimate down to 7 Pro) will also have to go ""clean"".

If you have to do 2) or 3), all is not lost--I'll explain in a moment.

Before you even buy 7 for your machine, stop by Microsoft's website for two things:

a) download and run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor.  Run it with every device connected to the machine that you'll ever want to use in 7.  It'll thoroughly examine your machine for any roadblocks and give you good advice about upgrading.
b) Go to the Windows 7 Compatibility Center and double-check anything that came up negative in the Upgrade Advisor (or didn't show up at all).  This site lists detailed compatibility info on a LOT of different devices.

Anything major, like a video card or sound card driver, I'd recommend also checking via the manufacturer's website to be sure a driver is available for it (and go ahead and download the driver while you're there).  This almost burned me on two of the machines that I upgraded.

c) Last, make a backup.  The free tool mentioned earlier (called Macrium Reflect) can do this for you.

Do you have to do a ""clean"" install, but just want to carry over your user accounts and settings?  Microsoft makes a program called Windows Easy Transfer that's already in Vista (and can be downloaded from Microsoft for XP) that will export your accounts and settings and let you import them back again.  It's very easy to use and does a good job of putting your accounts back together again, even going from XP to 7.

Do you have to do the ""clean"" install, and you don't want to reinstall all your programs?  Laplink has an offer ($19.95 to download from them, $9.95 as a boxed product here) that will let you use a special version of their program ""PC Mover"" to upgrade one machine one time.  Read the documentation in detail because there is a specific order in which you have to perform the steps for it to work.

The most important thing to doing a ""clean"" install is that in the Upgrade setup you choose ""Custom"".  Windows will take all of your major files and place them in a folder called ""Windows.old"".  PC Mover and the Easy Transfer program both rely on this folder to reconstruct your system from, so this is VERY important.

I wish I had more space to go into detail here...bottom line is, Windows 7 Professional makes sense for those needing to manage complex networks or run older programs that might not work in Windows 7.  However, the average Home user will do just fine with Windows 7 Home:  it's not as stripped-down as it was in the days of XP.

If you plan ahead a bit, upgrading to 7 will go very easily (and if it doesn't, you'll have something to fall back on).","I was first introduced to this company by a female user who is the lucky user of pcII, who is the lucky user of this and the others who are also users of the Netscape Professionnel.

I have no interest in logging into Intuit to download transactions that are none of their business.

I've long wished there was a suitable alternative to Quicken, as I've come to avoid Intuit products like the plague (some of you may remember when the company foisted it's C-Dilla copy protection scheme on purchasers of Turbo Tax one year, until consumer outrage forced them to back off).  I'm going to redouble my efforts to find something else to track my finances.","I have used this product for several years now and I have no idea why.

I already have Norton installed and purchased this in advance so I chose the 5 device key card. Also, you can try (15 or 30 day trial version) direct from Norton and, if you are happy, you can then get a key card to extend your subscription for an additional 366 days. I say choose the lowest cost to meet your needs.

Second, since I have been using Norton for years, I thought it would be easier just to renew my subscription with a key code. Plus, this one was for 5 devices so I could also include my 2 Android devices. Unfortunately, I encountered a problem with my key code on my second computer where it stated the key code was not for my product. I called Norton where a very courteous representative worked with me over the phone as well as online to complete my renewal subscription. Originally, she told me I would have to download a different version but, in the end, I was able to enter my key code to renew. I had no problem with my third computer.

My first (Lenovo tablet) Android device immediately upgraded (from lite Norton mobile version) to the full version once I signed into my Norton account. My second (Tianle TV stick) Android device did not upgrade where I needed to uninstall Norton for mobile app and re-install it. Once I re-installed the Norton for Mobile devices and signed into my Norton account, it immediately upgraded to full version.

Anyway, overall, I'm sure Norton AntiVirus is (and has been) a good product for internet online security. But, since there are many other good (and free) antivirus choices, I can only rate this product as okay. Also, I didn't like having a problem with my subscription renewal process.

FYI: I recommend including Norton's (free) Identity Safe program for computers and mobile app for Android/Apple devices. This is one of the better password manager interfaces. With Norton Identity Safe, you have your passwords easily available on any computer or device you may be using. Plus, when you add or update any site password, it is available on any other computer or device you are using.","I have been using Antivirus for too long and I was surprised that some of them have been discontinued.

It's a bummer having to trace around which operating system is best for your PC and if you have an old old PC the 32bit version is perfect and newer are 64bit.

So that being said, the operating system is FAST extremely FAST!!!!

Not a resource HOG like Windows Vista, Windows Vista had too many bugs and the AERO caused systems to crash and what not. Also, Windows Vista wasn't compatible with almost every Windows XP program. Windows 8 is different, it's better than Vista and may have a few draw backs. Windows 8 uses slightly more resources than Windows 7 which might not be a problem if you have a quick dual-core machine with a few gigs of RAM. And gaming is also an issue with Windows 8. No particular slowdowns, but the benchmarks are quicker for Windows 7. And of course, these are slight differences, in the long run Windows 8 will be running much quicker than Windows 8. The OS will be optimized BETTER than 7.

The drawbacks are yes, no start menu, but with a few learning curves you can get anything you need:

- Programs: windows key + q
- General features: windows key + x
- To lock is: windows key + l
- Windows files: windows key + f

And so on.

There are more draw backs like the fact that everything is hidden and in reality should be in plain sight. It's an OS designed for multicore CPUs and also for mobile operating systems. It's pretty similar to Windows 7, but doesn't support all of Windows 7's programs. There were a few that I had to uninstall because they weren't supported by Windows 8. And of course, Windows 7 had the virtual Windows XP which is something that I haven't seen in Windows 8. And also, Windows 8 doesn't play DVDs and Windows Media Center costs money and of course, other features costs money as well.

All in ALL the OS works, aren't many bugs, it's FAST, and will give it at 4.5 out of 5.",I have been using VirtualBox for quite some time and I was first introduced to it in Madera in the early 90's and for some years had them ship me the operating system to install it.

I remember convincing my boss to buy it for me - think of the productivity gains!  With Omnipage 8, my computer would easily read PDFs and I would never again have to retype electronic copy.  As my wife puts it, ""you should never have to type something more than once.""

Things didn't work quite as I planned. After spending hours training Omnipage to understand the most basic words, it never seemed to get any smarter.  Eventually, I gave up on Omnipage and instead purchased the full Adobe Acrobat, which has Optical Character Recognition (OCR) built in. The sucker is expensive for personal use though, so OCR remained forever beyond my reach.

Well here we are ten versions and over a decade later.  I installed the program, loaded it up, turned it on and...

It crashed. This was not a good sign.

After tinkering with Omnipage's incredibly kludgy interface, I remembered back ten years...to its incredibly kludgy interface.  The learning function didn't make Omnipage any smarter.  It was like a nightmare I never woke up from.

It seems Omnipage is not for your average user, but rather for lawyers looking to scan in business documents.  In other words, Omnipage wants nice clean sheets of white paper with typed text, not messy scans of magazines with creative layouts. I was about ready to give Omnipage a 1 rating.

Fortunately I didn't get around to writing the review right away.  And that's when I discovered Omnipage has built in functionality to scan any file in Windows with the right click of a button.

Omnipage's scanning ability is impressive.  It can incorporate graphics, retain formatting, and although it occasionally makes mistakes, it's not nearly as bad as older versions.  It exports to a variety of formats, the most useful being .PDF, .DOC, and .TXT. With the simple click of a button I suddenly have the power of OCR at my fingertips.  And I never have to open that eyesore of an interface.

All is forgiven, Omnipage. But you could use a shower and a shave.","I have been using Omnipage for the past 50+ years. It is now available for download and I can print it out as soon as I get online. It is so powerful and you can print it out as you go, but it is"

So, I have been working with Microsoft Office 2010 for the last seven or so months on three different computer platforms all running Windows 7 Enterprise Edition.  I use ""Microsoft Outlook 2010"" every day; it is one of the first applications I open in the morning and one of the last I close in the evening, so I am very familiar with the program and it functionality.

""Outlook 2010"" (the software can also be purchased separately), is the (Office) suite's business and personal communications/collaboration client for connecting to Microsoft Exchange, or external Internet based POP3 email providers like Yahoo Mail, Hotmail, Gmail, etc.

But, ""Outlook 2010"" is also a very robust (stand-a-lone) contact manager allowing one  to schedule meeting, create a To-Do Task List, keep track of Contacts, create Notes, and keep a running record of documents and emails sent and or received via Outlook Journal.  From very humble beginnings, Microsoft has turned Outlook into the must-have Contact Manager.

The first thing you'll notice about ""Outlook 2010"" is the new multi-colored splash screen on startup. This new yellow, orange, and red splash screen is common across all other Office Products as well.  But the (rounded) splash screen also relays information about what the product is doing during the load process; not that anyone will understand the verbiage.  But, for techies like me it looks cool!

Once ""Outlook 2010"" starts you will be greeted with a much smoother user interface with much smoother fonts and edges, as well as a more subtle color theme and an operational ribbon bar transplanted from the rest of the Office Suite.  Anyone familiar with Office 2007 will be right at home with the new Ribbon motif in Outlook 2010; Outlook 2007 was not so adorned.

All of the menu items in previous versions of Outlook have been moved to the Ribbon along with many new tasks/options.  All of these changes blend in nicely with Microsoft's upcoming Windows 7 operating system, but might take some getting used to for those not familiar with the Office Ribbon Bar.

Overall the layout of the interface remains unchanged from that of Outlook 2007.  However, the Inbox and the Sent Items Folder has been moved to the top of the folder list in the Folder List View, while there is more space between the folders.  User created mailbox folders are now pushed down below the Default Outlook Folders.  Nothing too radical, but the new Inbox location took me a little getting used to.

What Else is New?

64-Bit Performance: Perhaps the largest change to Office 2010 suite is the availability of both a 32-bit and 64-bit version of the suite.  This of course translates to better memory and processor usage, resulting in better performance throughout.

Conversation view has been added to Outlook 2010 much to the delight of fans of third-party email clients like Gmail. If an e-mail comes in that's a reply to the original message, any related messages to that particular subject line are displayed with it.  The default view is collapsed, but all of the messages in the conversation string, including the original sent mail and replies, can be displayed with a simple click of the mouse.

Forwarding a message as an attachment or Text Message now has a home in the form of a designated button(s) on the (Respond) section on the Home tab of the ribbon bar. Click on the button and a new email comes up with the selected message already as an attachment. Note: this feature will also work with multiple messages.  Note: in order to send a Text Message, you'll need to set up the service first.

Quick Steps is a fantastic new feature in ""Outlook 2010.""  Outlook Quick Steps--accessible via the Quick Steps section of the Home Ribbon bar--allow you to create shortcuts for various actions like automatically replying to a selected message and deleting, and or filing the original, or forwarding a message to a specific person, group of people, or even department.  And quick steps can even be assigned keyboard shortcuts.  Outlook 2010 includes a number of default Quick Steps, and new ones are very easy to create.

Voice-Mail Integration is now offered with Outlook 2010 and is used in conjunction with Exchange 2010 and Microsoft Office Communications Server (OCS) 2007 R2.  This feature creates an easy to use multi-media interface for playing back voice-mail messages.

HTML Rending Issues

Microsoft first started using Word to render the HTML content in Outlook 2007.
Microsoft has kept MS Word as the rending engine for creating HTML e-mails much to the chagrin of a large number of users who complain that Microsoft should a more industry standard engine.  MS Word, they say, does an incomplete job of rendering HTML graphics and text and a highly caustic campaign has been started via a website called Fixoutlook.org and is being supported by the Email Standards Project. The campaign claims to have more than 19,000 participants.

But Microsoft recently reaffirmed that is plans to move ahead with Word as the rendering engine in ""Outlook 2010.""  This was confirmed in a recent BLOG post by William Kennedy, Microsoft's Corporate VP for Office Communications and Forms.

Kennedy wrote ""Word has always done a great job of displaying the HTML which is commonly found in e-mails around the world. For e-mail viewing, Word also provides security benefits that are not available in a browser. Word cannot run web script or other active content that may threaten the security and safety of our customers.""

He went on to state: ""the 'Email Standards Project' does not represent a sanctioned standard or an industry consensus in this area. Should such a consensus arise, we will of course work with other e-mail vendors to provide rich support in our products.""

Personally, I have never had a problem creating or displaying HTML messages in Outlook 2007, nor have I had an issue with Outlook 2010 thus far, so I cannot relate.

Enough said.

My Thoughts

""Outlook 2010"" as a standalone application does not represent a huge a huge leap forward in the areas of contact management, Email communications, or scheduling.  But, when integrated with MS Exchange 2010 and MS OCS 2007, the program offers a wealth of new functionality in an enterprise setting.  Although the interface may look the same as Outlook 2007, this faade is somewhat deceptive, because underneath the skin lies a swift new program able to speak in 32, or 64-Bit computing.

However, despite the robust enterprise pedigree Outlook 2010 is perfectly fine for the standalone user, and or small office setting utilizing POP3 or HTML based mail.  The ability to install and run the 64-Bit version of the software is incentive enough for me to want to trade-up.  And while some may find the new Ribbon Bar intimidating (hey even I had to get used to it), given time it will prove a time-saver.  HTML rendering aside, Microsoft continues to improve its premiere messaging application; for me ""Outlook 2010"" is (still) the contact management program for me and remains the best on the market, period!","I'm a big fan of Microsoft's ""Invigorating Conversations"" software which enables me to quickly and efficiently manage my daily activities.

Neutral:
* Doesn't include a user manual--documentation must be downloaded from the Corel website (and it's highly recommended to do so and read it because...learning curve)

Cons:
* Learning curve -- I went through this with X6 Pro, but this upgrade moved a few things around and added a few features which sent me back to VideoStudion bootcamp, so it's wise to plan accordingly
* Ultra-strict licensing -- this isn't new, but still worth mentioning: If privacy is a major concern, you'll want to read and re-read the license agreement because there's a note in there about collecting potentially personally identifiable information, plus, you may only install this software on a single machine and should you wish to reinstall it on another machine, you'd need to contact Corel for permission.

Overall, this was a great upgrade from the previous version of VideoStudio with added useful features an the simplification of a few others.","Upgrading a machine is like a boatload of manual files.

With this Professional code, you don't actually have to pay an annual fee, but it's also only valid for the life of your PC. Your ONE PC. This is definitely not buy it once, have it forever software.  So, in other words, you'll probably have to buy Office code for your other computer or if one crashes. With that in mind, going Home Premium is probably the cheapest bet - and at least you can use the code on up to 5 computers - but you do have to pay up each year if you want to keep your software.

But now that I've griped about that, let me say that I am fairly impressed with the 2013 upgrade. The SkyDrive Cloud concept is obviously the most notable change, allowing you to save directly to your online storage space rather than to the hard drive. I think this is a great way keep documents updated and accessible anywhere without having to e-mail yourself the documents or trying to remember which version is which. Very cool.

Other than that, you'll find mostly cosmetic upgrades that will take some time getting used to and don't serve a lot of purpose, but do look nice. There are some really cool new templates, especially in Excel, that are worth checking out. When you type in Word there is a kind of delay or typewriter effect as the letters appear which is kinda cool I guess. At first I thought it was weird, but now I like it.

OVERALL: Although Office is going a little too far to milk the customer for every penny they're worth, I love the save-to-cloud upgrade that Office 2013 offers and am a fan of some of the new content/layouts. As everyone knows, Office is a must-have for pretty much everything we do in the world nowadays, and it is fabulous software. If you don't care about the cloud, however, don't feel like you have to rush out and upgrade.

I started to upload a youtube video, went away to have breakfast and came back to a blue screen of death.

Speaking of Internet Explorer, it crashes more than in XP. It just stops working, dims, shows that it's thinking and won't let you do anything for minutes. A company that can not even get a web browser to work right has no business selling an operating system. It's time to upgrade to Firefox.

Since I knew that the all-access portion worked on iPads, I figured that reinforced my hunch.  And yes, it does work with Mac and iPad, as well as Windows 8.1 machines.  (I have not tried it with Windows 10.)

To start learning Spanish, all you need to do is pop in the software DVD and install it on your computer.  If you do not have a DVD drive or if you are installing on a tablet, you need to visit the website to enter your email address and product key to begin the download.  The box also contains an interactive DVD and an MP3 audio CD.  I like that I can copy the audio to iTunes, although it's a little weird how it adds files to my Mac desktop in order to accomplish this.  It sounds like an extended game of Pong.

The software itself is pretty good, although your success will depend in part on how well you tend to grasp foreign languages.  All the PR around Instant Immersion language courses compares them to Rosetta Stone.  I can't make the comparison myself, having never tried Rosetta Stone, but I do know that this is a relatively easy method of teaching yourself Spanish, as long as you take advantage of all the tools.  I find that the trio of reading, speaking, and listening to the same words and phrases helps me learn faster.  I've tried other language courses that leave out one or the other, and that's much more difficult.  The pocket phrase guide, while extremely portable, is difficult to see with older eyes, and it's not necessarily easy to find what I want, even though the words/phrases are grouped by subject, such as days of the week or transportation.  Still, it's better than no guide at all.

This software teaches Latin American Spanish, which is great for most Americans but not so great if you plan to go to Spain.  I cannot find a way to change to European Spanish, so I assume that option is not available.  The iPad Talk Now app mirrors the computer version, which makes it easy to train yourself on one, then switch off to the other.  The Oscar Lake game will appeal to a wide range of ages.

I've used an older Instant Immersion program for Italian, and I find this newer version of the software to be less clunky and visually more friendly, something that's important if children will be using it.  This program is best for learning a smattering of Spanish, not for an in-depth learning program that covers the finer points of grammar and word nuances.  If your aim is to be able to converse a little or understand important written words, this is a great program.

After writing the review below, I tried two things.  First, I tried to go back and produce the same video via the Easy Editor option that I had tried the first time to no avail.  Once again, the program started rendering the file and it took hours...and it finally froze my computer...so it failed for me twice.

Second, I tried to play the disk that I had finally produced as mentioned below, and my DVD player simply stated ""disk not recognized.""  So, even the DVD I did finally manage to create is unplayable.

I really can't recommend this software....I suggest you try one of the Corel products instead.  I seriously question whether or not Cyberlink runs beta tests on products like this prior to releasing them to the market.  This ended up being nothing but a time wasting, frustrating experience for me.

Original review here:
Let me say first of all that I am not a professional video producer by any means.  Im just a dad who likes to catch home movies of family vacations, birthdays, graduations, etc. on video and then transfer them over to a disk, either through Blue-ray or through AVCHD formats.  I like to put a snazzy title at the beginning, put some subtitles in along the way that explains where we were and when, and chop out those moments when I forgot to turn off the camcorder and we get to see what footwear everyone was wearing that day.

The best software I have found so far has been Corel VideoStudio Pro X7.  It allows me to do all of the above very easily.

I took about 90 minutes of HD video that I have on an SD card and gave this PowerDirector 14 software from Cyberlink a shot.  It proved to be fairly frustrating for me, far more so that what I have experienced with the Corel software.

When you open the software for the first time, you have to put in your key code, which I found odd because this is usually requested when you load the software onto your computer, not when you first open it.  Anyway, once that was done, a screen come up that gives you five choices: 1) Full Feature Editor, 2) Easy Editor, 3) Express Project, 4) Theme Designer, and 5) Slide Show Creator.  The second and third choices are supposedly easier to navigate...created for novices like me, allowing you to progress upward at your own pace to do more things, and arguably more complicated things, with your video production.

I chose Easy Editor.  First I had to load my files, and I did this by either importing a file or a folder, which was fairly straight forward, and took a few minutes because I had around 280 HD files.  It would pop up occasionally telling me that an error had occurred, which was actually images it was trying to load that I had embedded into my video files (my camcorder automatically takes photos when it sees a smiling face).

It then moves to a Style section that gives you a choice, albeit rather limited, of title frames to put on your video.  After this, you go to an Adjustment section where you can add music, and then you click on a Preview section where you get Magic Style is analyzing your movieplease wait.

This is where things fell apart for me.  I waited.and waited.and waitedand after several hours the little bar that indicates its progress got to about 59%, and then the software became unresponsive.  By this time it was 10:00 at night (and I had started the process that afternoon), so I finally just shut the project down and called it a day.

Not one to give up, the next day I tried Express Project, and struggled for a while to figure out how to capture the files from my SD card.  I finally ended up dragging the files to the timeline.  This time the choices for the title frame were even sparser for some reason, but I picked one and off I went.  The entire process this time took me about two hours.

At the end, when you are about to burn to disk, you have a myriad of choices for file sizes and formats for the burnjust make sure you have the right media to accommodate this.  At first I tried to use a DVD+R DL disk, but no matter what format I selected, the disk was too small for the size of the project.  I finally ended up burning a Blue-ray disk.

Its also worth noting that I have a fairly powerful PCwith an Intel Core i7 processor and 12GB of RAM.  I suggest you make sure you have some fairly serious horsepower for this software if you elect to purchase it.  For HD editing, they recommend 6GB of memory for a 64 bit OS (which I have) and for 4K editing.

Although my first attempt to use this software was met with frustration, I am sure things will improve as I use it more and I learn its unique features.  It has MANY great capabilities, including editing and producing 4K video, which is the main reason I wanted it.  I have a 4K television, and plan to get a 4K camcorder soon.

However, to be quite honest here, if you are just a family video guy like me and don't really need all the whistles and bells, I suggest you go with something a bit more basic, like the VideoStudio Pro X7 I mentioned early.

But, if you think you might want to get into the video production world a bit heavier and have software that is future proofed to at least some degree, this option from CyberLink is definitely a great choice.  Just be prepared to put some time in to learn all of its features.they are substantial.  I plan to stick with it and try to learn as many as I can, time permitting.  In the time it has taken me to render on DVD with PowerDirector, I could have produced three or four with VideoStudio.

I hope my experience has helped you to some degree.  If you have any questions feel free to ask, and as I use it more, should things change, I will update the review.  Thanks for reading!","I was disappointed that Avalon discontinued its beta release. It's a bit slow and the video is too grainy for a single person, so I didn't feel myself obliged to write a review.

And, like other video rendering software, it is slow and clunky. It has, however, solved a problem for me that makes it worth using.

I recently tried to sync videos to my iPhone and found that many videos that played fine on my iPod would not transfer to the iPhone. These included a couple of movies I had transferred using Handbrake Lite and several QuickTime videos I had downloaded as part of an online course. The QT videos had been converted to iPod format using iTunes.

After doing some research online, I found this was a common problem because of slight variations in the encoding for iPod and iPhone video. Although some videos will play on both, others (including some converted through iTunes) will not.

The files converted by Crunch in standard iPhone format play in iTunes, and sync with both the iPod and the iPhone. I was able to successfully convert files that had previously played only in iTunes and on the iPod, and get them to work on the iPhone, too.

I tried this software on both a Windows XP PC and a Mac. Both worked well. The Mac interface is a bit cleaner and might be considered easier to use, although both are simple. The main advantage the PC version has is that in addition to a bar showing the progress of the file conversion, the percentage complete is displayed. It makes it easy to estimate the time remaining in the conversion.

So this is not the software you want to back up your collection of DVD movies. (Try Handbrake for that if you are on a Mac.) But if you want to convert video files to play in iTunes, and on both your iPod and iPhone, this will do what you need.","I use this contain to help me keep my copy protected.

Apparently, if the news at C-Net is correct, Intuit has backed off on those fees and is 'responding to customer feedback and concerns' and going back to old rules when it comes to the product.  I guess the marketing genuises and/or bean counters at Intuit didn't do enough research on how the mob with the pitchforks would react upon hearing the news of the changes in the rules for product usage this year.  (It's not like pollsters ever get things wrong, right?)

I expect that Intuit got feedback along the way that said that the pricing change and restrictions on the product usage weren't going to be problems for most of their users.  Worst case that's what they heard from the product management team and others involved in helping to set prices and policy I'm sure.  To be fair, if they had given advance notice that the rules were going to be changing, customers may not have reacted (some would say over-reacted) to the changes so harshly, but unfortunately for many customers they weren't made aware of the changes until *after* they got boxed product home and were reading through the materials that came with it (or worst yet, until after they started using the product and bumped into the request to pay an additional fee).

This is just the next in a line of mis-steps made by management at Intuit/Turbo Tax when it comes to this product.  One would hope they'd learn their lesson once and for all, but I really am not sure they ever really will.

Will I use this year's product?  I honestly don't know.  I've been a loyal customer for many years, but they really have stepped in the stinky stuff this season and I'm just not sure I want to reward them (even if they have tried to make nice with customers).

Best of luck to purchasers of the product.

(New rating would probably be up in the 4/5 range if rating the product alone.  Unfortunately for the folks at Intuit, the ratings can't be changed after the fact the way the reviews can be edited)

============================
Original scathing review left below:
Original review title: Increased prices+new fees+less flexibility=1 star

I've been a loyal TurboTax user for many years now, but over those years the geniuses at TurboTax have thumbed their nose at myself and other customers several times, showing outright disdain for their customers.

It's senseless to use the space here to complain about their past mistakes, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be raking them over the coals for getting greedy on prices for the 2008 version of this software.  The price increase (suggested retail pricing) of 33 percent is out of line.  Defenders of the product will say ""but it includes free..."" and that may be the case, but it's still that much more expensive to walk out the store with compared to last year. Lowering the fees in one place and making them up on the retail price just shifts money around needlessly and makes their software seem that much more expensive compared to competitors, or worse yet, compared to just getting plain old paper forms and doing taxes the old fashioned way.

Worse than the price increase though is that apparently TurboTax is tired of having their product used to do taxes for a whole family, or for friends of the family.  I sympathize with them in wanting to be paid fairly for their work, but they could have made things clearer on just how many returns the software could be used to manage/print/handle in the past.  Instead, they're now restricting the ability to do multiple returns with a single product and have chosen to do that on top of the increase in the price of the product.  Double whammy.

Of course the reviewers here at Amazon are making use of their review space to slam the product and protest these moves and as you can see I'm piling on too.

I like the product, but given the changes for the current year I'm seriously considering my alternatives.  Just how bad is TaxCut by comparison?  (From what I've heard of the product, it deserves a good hard look :-/)","I've used CROWD products for years and loved them.............

1. I have done a full scan on my computer 3 times now and yet every time I restart my computer it tells me I have a security issue and that my computer has not had a full scan in a week.

2. I put the settings on gamer mode for my husband's computer. Gamer mode does not turn on and off with the click of a button like it is supposed to. I have to go in and change all the settings around each time. VERY inconvenient and time consuming.

3. I receive critical error messages DAILY where bitdefender wants me to send in copies of my log files so they can investigate the problems.

4. I also keep receiving a message that tells me bitdefender needs to be updated. The update fails every time.

5.  I have been having issues with some programs like Corel studios ever since I installed this. Could be a coincidence I guess but considering all the other problems I have been having with bitdefender I wonder....

The only positive things I have seen for this software are the anti-spam buttons integrated into my outlook express and the fact that the scan is quicker than I am used to. At least it would be quicker if I didn't have to do it repeatedly!

I am going to tinker with it for another week (maybe) and then go back to Norton or try out Vipre which seems to be working really well on our kids computer.

Loved it. I wanted version 5 ""Platinum"" so that I could make Video CDs. But it looks like 5 can't read some AVI formats that every other program I have can read with no problems at all.
In addition, 5's audio noise reduction algorithms are horrible. It sounds better to leave even noisy vinyl untouched. The ""Realizer"" enhancement function must be designed for the tinniest of cheap speakers, because on any decent system it gives way too much bass. Before getting Easy CD 5, I happily encoded MP3s at 128kbps, but Easy CD 5's encoding sounded horrible at that rate, forcing me to use the more wasteful 160kbps.
Then, when I finally had something I wanted to put on CD, I found that my trusty CD-RW drive was unable to make any CDs at all. Even though the program reported ""CD created successfully"", any audio or data CD I made crashed Windows as soon as I tried to read it.
I can't think of anything I like about the program, and I don't think it's a coincidence that my Windows system is very unstable since I installed Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum.","I've used CD burner for quite some time.

Very smooth operation, yet many options are available that I haven't even gotten to try out. I'll be honest, the machine I'm using this software on was designed and built to take advantage of multi-threaded processing/rendering and it has preformed most efficiently. I believe my opinion of this software will grow even more positive with use and becoming more familiar with many of its undiscovered options.

Update: I began to read reviews on the newest version (X7) and decided to upgrade. The results are even better as this version
is built around the 64 bit architecture for those who have 64 bit machines. I was a bit confused because Corel indicated this will work with 32 bit or 64 bit machines yet the electronic download from their site clearly separates the two. My assumption would be that the retail package would contain both iterations.

I've been using Quicken ever since it came out, and Managing Your Money before that, and MS Money for a couple of years. I was satisfied with the 2008 version. There are some improvements in the latest version, most notably the faster updating and the ability for the update to bypass the frequent requests by some banks for answers to security questions. Additionally, I noticed a correction to estimated taxes. The Tax Schedule used to include the January 15th payment in the wrong year, but now you can identify the tax year involved and the report will be correct.

There are two complaints I have and that is the Tax Planner still will not allow you to choose the next year. It is locked on 2011. The other is the tax schedule lists interest by banks, but does not subtotal each bank. Your tax return requires interest be reported by each bank. If I discover anything more I will update this review.

Update:

I moved this review from the guide book to the product itself.

One change I do not like is the way the ""overview"" presents itself now.  Previously, the individual account holdings were shown and no other stock would appear, but now the complete list of stocks you have in your portfolio list shows and you must scroll through it to find the stocks that are currently in the particular account.  I have a long list of stocks, perhaps a hundred that I have bought and sold over the years.  Most are inactive, but they show anyway.  What a mess this is.  I liked the 2008 version of the ""overview"" far better.

I noticed a small problem.  When you reconcile an account you have the option to use a statement or the online balance.  Once you have chosen ""statement"" it seems to always return to statement even if you have subsequently elected to use the online balance method.  I have tested this many times by unchecking the statement choice and even going as far as removing the statement balance, then selecting the online balance method.  The very next time you reconcile it will choose ""statement"" for you.  It is an annoying inconvenience.

One other minor issue is the sound effects.  When you first open Quicken there is a very loud gong noise that will make you wish you had left the sound system off.  The remaining sound is like an old manual cash register ringing up a sale and is tolerable.  Due to the startling nature of the opening ""gong"" I went into preferences and turned the sound off.  My overall assessment is that this product is worth the price even at retail, but you can get a very good deal if you search for it.  I pretty much use Amazon because the prices are really good and you can trust them.  No, I don't work for them or own stock, but I wish I bought a boatload when it was at 32 cents a share!

Let me describe one huge advantage of getting frequent or daily updates.  You can check your credit cards for errors well ahead of the arrival of the statement.  If your card has been stolen you can track its use.  You can inform your issuer in detail about what is yours and what is not, and you can contact the stores where the illegal purchases have been made.  In other words you can stay on top of your credit card activity.  I have used Quicken this way for years and have discovered duplicate charges, and erroneous charges by businesses within hours of the charge being made.

Update:
Do not import data from Quicken into tax software without realizing that there will be errors.  When interest for December is credited it normally gets posted in January therefore when you create a tax schedule it will include the previous year's December and not include the current December.  So, when you make the tax schedule you must do a custom search avoiding interest posted in the wrong year and capturing data for the current tax year posted in the following year.  I recommend waiting for the tax forms from your financial institutions before submitting your tax return.",I was really disappointed when I tried the latest version of Windows Update and I couldn't believe how well it performs in the current version. It was discontinued by the original version and I now have a much better understanding of how to pay

I've tried other applications (Roxio and others), but for Windows users, previous versions of Nero have set the standard in this category of applications.

Version 8 shows some issues that Nero should *not* let continue:

(1) The package can only be described as ""bloated"". The current downloadable version is over 180 MB. While this is not an issue if you have broadband, Nero inexplicably doesn't include the product's help files in the download content.

So, in order to use Nero's ""Help"" functions, you then have to download and install them separately. This is quite silly when the help file download size are less than 3MB in size! With the application installer approaching 200 MB, what's 2 MB among friends!

Nero's web site says leaving out the help files is deliberate ""in order to to keep the download file small"". Note to Nero: the download file is already huge...so please just add the help files.

The bloat comes in many forms, from a CD cover designer to Nero InCD.

Note 2 to Nero: in these days of rewritable DVDs, 4GB flash drives and inexpensive hard drives, do you really think users would still choose a proprietary format CD/DVD packet writer for archiving or storage?), to Nero Home (which it claims can integrate your media streaming through multiple machines), the download, installation -and, ultimately, the overall experience of this product-- is compromised by a large volume of marginally useful applications that detract from what Nero does well: create and reformat data for optical media. Take the time to select the ""custom"" install option, and leave out those apps you don't plan to use.

(2) Lots of waiting time. Nero installation takes a *long* time. Not a real issue if you only have to go through the process once. But: on a clean Windows XP machine, I had to go through it twice (due to some errors that crept up, directly related to the bloat described above and the Windows resource issues described below).

(3) Slow to launch once installed. It takes a long time for Nero Version 8 applications to launch. Even if you have a fast processor and abundant memory: after you decide to launch the application, be prepared to wait before you start to rip and burn.

(4) Unexplained Windows resource drain. Nero Version 8 runs a background process called ""NMIndexingService.exe""  This process runs whether whether you've launched Nero or not. When other applications do this, it's often called malware. While this can be disabled by advanced Windows users using the msconfig tool, there's no obvious utility to this service, and no excuse for it being hidden deep in Windows. Shame on Nero for this. Nero's email response to a question about this I submitted took two weeks to arrive. The recommended  a reinstall of Nero...but first you have to download a separate utility called ""Nero Clean Tool"" and then reinstall that. Just as with the help files: an effective uninstaller routine should be a given for modern Windows applications.

(5) For as widely used as Nero products are, their support website is remarkably uninformative.

-Once you get past all this, once installed and launched Nero 8 still is great program for authoring CD/DVDs and ripping MP3s. But the issues above are hugely distracting, and Nero should have more respect for its customers than to make them jump through these hurdles.

-Nero needs to get back to basics, trim the fat, and offer customers what  they really want, and what it does best: sound, fast CD/DVD writing. Nero  should include the help files, discard the less useful components, and respect users' Windows resources when they aren't engaged in its basic ripping and recording.

-If you have a stable version of an earlier version: Don't move to Version 8.","I'm a bit concerned about the size of the USB drive, so I decided to use this one instead. The other one I bought is the X-Box. It has a built-in processor and it works perfectly to"

Those who are ripping this software as 'terrible' or 'unusable' as being overly harsh. Does it have some frustrating issues? Sure. Is it worthless and unusable? Not at all.

Word, which is the application I spent about half my work hours using, is in many cases easier to use in the 2007 version. While I'm not a huge fan of the ribbon, I don't have issues locating what I need nor do I have problems customizing it to include the features I use most often. Overall I can find exactly what I need when I need it. I think most of the complaints that I read about the ribbon have more to do with users unable to adapt than with a real design flaw inherent to the system of organization. The new DocX file format creates smaller file sizes than the old standard, but at the expense of versatility, as un-patched versions of Microsoft Word will not open them.

Excel is fantastic. The 2007 version is impressively fast compared to 2003. I can use tilt tables with 200 variables without a second delay. Also, the ability to create very high quality charts and graphs that seamlessly integrate with Power Point and Word is fantastic. I've been able to make nicer looking reports in less time than ever before. Excel is the biggest overall improvement from 2003 especially in the visual department. The addition of a wide variety of visual styles for reports is welcome and very useful.

Another great change to Excel is the detailed descriptions for each command that are available in the help section. There is still some streamlining that is missing; too much of the program is still dependent on old macro commands that no one but long time users of things like Lotus Notes have a vocabulary for.

Power Point is also a nice improvement. Adding images and then tweaking them is easier than ever. As I mentioned previously, taking charts and graphs from Excel to PP is very easy. You can use cut-and-paste, or import them directly. The resulting PP files are also smaller than the previous format, which is great for e-mailing them to people.

The much maligned DocX format was initially a real gaffe for Microsoft; not making it immediately usable by Office 2003 users was simply moronic. Although they've released several patches that do allow full implementation between 2003 and 2007 versions of Office, these updates are large (over 50mb) and while businesses most certainly have updated, it's far less likely that your friend, brother, etc., has. Sending a DocX file to those without the patch can create a bit of chaos.

Overall Office 2007 is an improvement over 2003, even if you hate the ribbon. The speed increases, added features, and integration of excel, word, and PP in a way that lets them all play together nicely is well worth the upgrade.","I am a professional user of Microsoft Office Professionnel, who for me loves the simplicity of this software and its ability to run it at my desk.

I spent a couple hours researching the various options and decided on this Webroot Internet Security Complete 2016.

Before installing (from disc) I made sure to do a complete uninstall of Kaspersky so I would not have issues during install.
I installed this on my desktop (HP, Windows 7) and laptop (also HP, Windows 7) and had no problems with installation at all.  The disc did not auto run on either so I opened up the file folder and started it manually (select WRSetupCD).

It was a very quick install, took about 7 minutes on each computer and that included the initial scan it does during installation.  I did an additional scan just to be sure after install and that took 1 minute and 24 seconds.

During set up it asks you to review and accept agreement.  It asks for your email address.  It gives you the option to receive special offers and newsletter from them or not to.

Pros
+ Reasonably priced
+ Very quick install
+ User-friendly interface.  Very easy to navigate and understand what you are seeing.
+ Not obtrusive.  Doesn't slow down my computers or interfere with performance at all
+ Quick scans
+ Useful Utilities (System Optimizer cleans up files and System Analyzer lets you know ways you can improve your computer's performance)

My experiences in this have been enduring constant frustration with Liquid Edition 6 and then some video editing solace with Sony Vegas.  With my recent upgrade to Windows Vista I not only was one of the few absolutely delighted with the switch I also found a nice, extremely user-friendly video editing program in the new Windows Movie Maker.  Of course, Windows Movie Maker is also rather limited.  What it does it does well. But if a person wants to go beyond that they had to take a rather big leap to the next levels of programs.

With Corel Ulead VideoStudio I find an amazing progression from absolutely basic/entry level to highly functional and flexible.  Again and again recently I have found Corel to be the master of designing programs that are both highly capable and highly oriented towards the user experience.  Meaning their programs do a lot and are always surprising how easy they are to pick up and use.  This video software is no exception. It has the user friendliness of Windows Movie Maker with substantially more capability and options.

The learning curve is very slight.  Not because everything can be picked up quick but rather because Corel has approached this program understanding that not everyone can spend the hours and hours learning about software before getting to a real project.  Instead, they have built in different modes of working.  From the really basic Wizard that is a lot like movie maker to a more robust editing context that allows for a whole lot of creativity.

And within that more expansive creativity they have made for a very wonderful ease of use, with the layout and the functions quite easily recognizable and quite easily applied. The arcane qualities of most video software are pushed aside for very clear, very obvious tools.

At each step I found myself easing my way into more and more knowledge.  And that's another quality I've noticed with Corel. The software itself is a teacher in a way.  And not a boring one. Rather, unlike so much headache inducing software (Liquid Edition) this Corel was actually fun. Again the emphasis on the user came out.

No this is not as robust as some other programs.  But it is also significantly less expensive and significantly less resource demanding. I used it on my high quality Dell XPS 710 quad processor, 4GB, up to date video card, Windows Vista desktop (noticing it was faster than other video programs). Of course it worked well on that.  I also used it on my Dell e1405 XP laptop, bought for battery life, that has no video card, sound card, and only 1GB of memory.  It didn't run as fast, of course, but it still worked great. Surprisingly great.

I'm absolutely pleased with VideoStudio and will be heartily recommending it to friends and family. I've not gotten even to the full extent of learning this program--I'm excited about applying Flash to future video projects--and yet I don't feel like I'm missing anything.

This is an ideal mid-level video software meant for people who want to step up in their production but don't want to, or need to, invest in the higher level programs. It's very user friendly, very processor/memory friendly, while offering a wonderful progression of capability for any level user--whether the absolute beginner or the master wanting to do something quick and without bother.

Love this and look forward to a lot more video work in coming months and years.  Corel has made it actually fun.  And that is a huge thing for those of us who don't particularly love sitting in front of the computer all the time.","I was first introduced to this program by a female user, and immediately afterward, I tried it for myself.

The interface is simple, good-looking, and even fun.  This is the kind of hobby software you wish for.

Know that if you are going to be editing HD movies, have the hottest quad processor and as much RAM as you can manage.  I've got an AMD quad clocked to 4GHz, 8GB of RAM, and dual nVidia 9600s in SLI, which easily handles everything I throw at it, including high-power games that make PS3 and XBox consoles look and feel like cheap smartphones.  But when I edit HD, it gives my machine a serious workout.  Thankfully, VSX4 has a brilliant way to relax this if you need it by way of using proxy files.

Also know that this software, as great as it is, is several products combined.  For example, DVD MovieFactory is no longer bundled with the software - they actually incorporated it right into the software (they didn't even change the menus one single bit).

Thank heavens, the crashy bugs are largely worked out now.  I have yet to have this software crash on me.  Also has some really super fun playtoy things to amuse yourself with, like 3D, time lapse, and stop-motion, which work surprisingly well, allowing you to make up for any features your camcorder may not have built-in.  This kind of software can take the drudgery out of video editing and actually turn a chore into a hobby.  I am now having just as much fun (if not more) editing my video as I previously did watching it.

Rendering times could have been MUCH better in this software, the result of 32-bit software.  VSX4 just doesn't work my machine very hard.  If it was 64-bit, it would be a dream.

Converting 2D video to 3D is the only ""candy"" feature I have played with.  Not spectacular, but it works and adds some fun depth to some otherwise boring video (3D depth is adjustable).  Fun to toy around with but not take too seriously.  If it wasn't shot in 3D from the beginning, don't expect much from a 2D to 3D conversion in terms of what you see in the movie theaters.  If you don't try to take it too seriously, you'll have some fun with it (and maybe a few headaches from the red/blue glasses).  VSX4 DOES support side-by-side color 3D, which requires special video hardware to watch, like a 3D TV and the shutter glasses.  My gear arrives next week, so I'll play around with it some more, really looking forward to full-color side-by-side 3D.  It's like Christmas.

Something that I absolutely LOVE about this software that needs to be mentioned that PowerDirector doesn't have:  being able to add/remove DVD/Blu-ray chapter marker points right on the timeline as you edit.  Then, when you finally get around to opening up the ""Share"" section of the program, which allows you to build the menus for your DVDs and Blu-Rays (and do the burn), your chapter markers are already there, and all you have to do is worry about the visuals of the menus themselves - the chapter marker work you did on the timeline itself is already done and saved.  NICE.  Even better, you can do more chapter marker editing while in the menu creation process in case you missed anything.  NICER.

Another thing I love is the WYSIWYG preview/work window you're using to work on your video.  It is playing working in high res HD - not the heavily pixelated version of the video you see in PowerDirector.  PD9 probably has a function somewhere to enable HD viewing/working, but VSX4 comes up that way as default.  Note that viewing/editing in HD slows the software down quite painfully - looks nice but this is where the 32bit aspect of the software really comes back to bite you hard, severely, and non-stop.

Highly recommended.  With all the bugs of previous versions, the software was virtually worthless - it was as ""crash-happy"" as PowerDirector.  Now it's actually worth paying for.  4 out of 5 stars because, well, Adobe Production Suite CS5 it ain't.

* UPDATE *

After finally getting around to moving on to creating Blue-Rays from DVDs, I have some new information, both good and bad.

The Good:

This software is solid as a rock.  It NEVER crashes.  I have never lost any work due to a crash, and it performs reliably no matter how badly it chokes on what I feed it.

The Bad:

Performance:  It chokes on what I feed it.  Working with HD video brings this 32-bit software to its knees.  It does not bring your computer to its knees - just the VSX4 software itself.  Yeah, I know, I can throw it into proxy mode AS A BAND-AID DUE TO LIMITATIONS OF THIS 32-BIT SOFTWARE, but with a system like mine, that shouldn't even have to be considered.  VSX4 is VERY sluggish when working with HD.  It won't crash on you, but you'll be continually waiting (after hitting playback buttons, dragging jog bars, working with effects and transitions, mode shifts, etc) for the software to catch up to itself as it chews hard on any HD video you feed it.  I spend a LOT of time stopping preview/playback, which collapses into ""slideshows"",  so I can wait for this software to ""catch up"" to itself before resuming a smooth playback.  This collapse into jerky slideshow playback happens whenever adding transitions, effects, etc.  LOTS of lagging going on.  This is the worse experience I have ever had on my custom-built 4GHz 64-bit Quad (8GM ram, 2 TB drive space).  It is the only software on my system that totally fails at using the raw horsepower available on my system.  All 4 processors are being used, but only in 32-bit mode - the software is not capable of using the 64-bit power of my system, which leaves virtually half the resources of my system unused as it chokes and stutters on HD. I should NOT be forced to throw the software into proxy mode when I'm running solid 64-bit OS on 64-bit hardware.  Corel - 32-bit is now an albatross around your neck.  It was time long ago to crank this product out in 64-bit.  PD9 might crash endlessly and have the worst tech support on the planet, but you're still getting clobbered by it just because it's 64 bit.  Even I went and paid for PD9 Ultra64 - it's that important.

Next Problem - Menus:  When editing the menus, your changes are not saved.  MAJOR bug.  A progress bar goes across the screen, but when you go to open your project back up, whaddya know - all your DVD/Blu-Ray disc menu work is gone.  Didn't save. This is a long-standing bug in the DVD MovieFactory 7 software that Corel integrated into VideoStudio for the X4 version.  I have to wonder if anybody even did the most simple of testing at Corel.  Was surprised to see this glaring bug carry over.

Next Problem:  Sound Stuttering:  The Blu-Ray discs this software cranks out are visually beautiful, excellent quality, virtually no noticeable drop in quality from source to output whatsoever.  But if you don't use transitions between video segments, there are sound gaps between scenes.  These are skips in the sound, like the software was choking during conversion or someone hitting ""mute"" for a fraction of a second on every scene change (and the sound from the next scene, when it finally kicks in, jolts you into annoyance).  I am still investigating if this is actually on the Blu-Ray discs VSX4 is cranking out or if it is how my PS3 is playing the Blu-Rays (never seen my PS3 do that with any other discs).  However, there has also been a couple of instances where I noticed some very noticeable sound slippage (people's mouths are sometimes not moving in sync when you hear them speaking or other sounds not matching the action on screen).  The slippage seems to be random, and also seems to happen only once in a while, and for short periods that last only a minute or so, but the sound stutter between scene changes are constant and reliably annoying.  Sound slippage was a very annoying bug carried over from DVD MovieFactory 7.  In fairness, ALL video production products can exhibit sound slippage, so I'm not specifically pointing at Corel on this one.  But the jolting sound gaps between scenes with no transition effects are horrible.  I have resorted to using transitions as a band-aid to keep this from happening(!) when creating Blu-Ray discs.  Being the novice videographer that I am, even I know that's bad.

Another problem:  The menus, transitions and most of the effects are extremely limited.  Even after adding the ""bonus pack"" and ""content pack"", you wind up with only about a dozen DVD menu template options and only 8 Blu-Ray menu options.  And most of the menu choices are ridiculously childish - certainly nothing you'd use if you are attempting to take your video work seriously in any way.  I still have yet to find good instructions on building my own Blu-Ray menu templates.  I hear about it, but have found no instructions.  I guess I just have to use the Force.

One final nitpick:  Downloadables/online content.  Sorry, Corel, but CyberLink's got you nailed on this one.  VSX4 is a fantastic product, if not a bit TOO simplistic, but it pales in comparison to the universe of PowerDirector's online/downloadable content.  One thing that VSX4 has going for it that CyberLink needs to pay attention to is that VSX4 does not insult you every step of the way by forcing you to ""Register"" or ""Activate"" different functions of the software as you actually go into the software to use it.  Well done, Corel, for showing CyberLink how it's done and for not treating your customes like criminals (why you got my money).

As as I wind down, I'll just offer that my ultra-hot 64-bit quad processor, 8GB of ram, and 2TB of SATA drive space should have no problem whatsoever cranking out a high quality product with this software.  So far I'm happy with most everything in the whole, and I continue to use the product.  But I'm dropping this now $65 product (about what I paid on Corel's web site) down to 2 Stars because of megasuck performance, menu issues, and sound quality issues on Blu-Ray discs.

HOWEVER:

Tech Support:  Corel's tech support is fantastic (listen up, CyberLink victims):  I get responses from Corel's web/email tech support within 12 hours like clockwork, and they are helpful.  They even ask me if I need any more assistance after they answer my questions or point me in the right direction.  Their online tech support forum is great, very helpful.  During regular business hours, I have called Corel's phone support and get a live person every time, speaking clear English, with very helpful information and my issues get solved.  Hear that, CyberLink? Corel customers aren't treated like thieves, pirates or criminals, and Corel doesn't make you provide 5 different pieces of evidence that the customer actually paid for the software, only to be denied service anyway - which is what CyberLink does.  Never have I seen a company treat its own customers (paycheck) so poorly as CyberLink.  Corel - well done.

In light of Corel's excellent and responsive tech support, both through email, the support forum, and on the phone(!), which I have consistently had great service from, and for the fact that the software just does not crash anymore (wow!), I'm jacking this review back up to 3 stars.

I am, Corel, giving you 3 stars because I am assuming that you are going to address the issues above.

Thanks for tolerating this review.

------------UPDATE---2012-06-24------------------------
Recently the software has been hanging, and badly.  It seems that whenever I start moving around in the software, the software just hangs, and ""Not Responding"" is displayed in the top title bar.  Service Pack 1 did not fix the problem.  It's never done this to me before, but now does it pretty much non-stop.  It takes anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes for VideoStudio to recover from this problem and unfreeze so I can continue - only to see it lock up yet again.  But even when I finally stumble through to the burn process, now it won't burn any Blu-Ray I'm working on - it comes up with an error 2 hours into the disc creation process, and that's not even getting to the burn part yet.  VERY frustrating. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, to no avail.  Even worse - I upgraded to VideoStudio X5 and it's doing the same exact lockup/freeze thing.  And as much as I hate to say it, I was also shocked to see that Video Studio X5 is STILL 32-bit!  HUH?!?  As such, I'm getting ready to tuck my tail between my legs and shift over to 64-Bit PowerDirector 10 if I can't get this working.  I can't believe it's come to this.  VideoStudio produces noticeably better quality output than PowerDirector, which is why I'm using this product (the reason for this is that VSX drops 60fps video down to 30fps video while maintaining a high 24mb bitate so it doesn't have to compress it into a bunch of pixelated mush like PowerDirector does).  But if I can't use the product, then I can't use the product.  Period.  Sorry, but I've got to kick the stars down to 2 at this point due to being still 32-bit (this is 2012!) and the recent lockup issues with both VSX4 and VSX5.  Too bad, I really like this software due to quality of it's actual output, which is better than any other product.  But I just might have to move on now.

-----------------------Another update-------------------
I have discovered the cause of the problem.  I discovered that two of the video clips that I was trying to work into a video sequence were corrupt files.  VSX was chokig on it, this is what caused the lockups.  Sadly, I was not able to complete my project with VSX.  Even sadder was having to use CyberLink's PowerDirector, which was able to work with the corrupted files without any problems.  Ouch.  Ok, Corel,  back up to 3 stars again because the corrupted video files were my fault.  But again - PD10 was able to use my files and VSX wasn't.  I repeat - Ouch.",i love this stuff! i love it! i love it! i love it! i love it! i love it! i love it!!It works

I already had an external SATA drive which I increased in size to 2 TB also.  I have the system working well and can share folders and have mapped network drives between the computers and the NAS.  So it is time to install Ghost 15.0.

The installation works well but when I set up a backup I can't access the NAS shared folder for the back-up.  I keep getting a error: ""Multiple connections to a server or shared resource by the same user, using more than one user name, are not allowed."".  It turns out that Ghost has to access the NAS using a user name that does not come from the PC being backed-up. I had to Un-Map all my network drives and reboot. I added a ""Ghost"" user name to the NAS (Nas-name) with its own password.  I made a new network drive Q: with the location \\Nas-name\username; Re-connect at log-on; CONNECT USING A DIFFERENT USER NAME The user name to make the connection was ""Nas-name\Ghost"" and the corresponding NAS password.  I then added the normal network drive connection Z: under the normal user name.

OK, I have found out how to do this after many hours when they could have provided some warning and instructions in probably 2-4 sentences.  The backup completes without any errors.

I worked hours searching the forums and trying differnt things.  The Norton technician also did a remote link for 1.5 hours and he still could not get it to function.

I mainly use video editing programs to trim down personal videos to make them a more watchable and enjoyable size, so I'm reviewing this from that perspective.  I don't use these for film class or to try to become the next Spielberg.  I simply want to clean up and edit my video.  For this particular example, I used eight clips from a Sony Action cam that I recently filmed on vacation and an MP3 song encoded at 256kbps as background music. I only used one track each for video and audio.

The only effects I added were a few transitions. I'm not really into effects other than basic titles.  Since I planned to use this project as the example for my review, I added the transitions to see how theyd affect encoding.  My PC has an Intel 2.8mhz dual-core i7 processor, 512GB SSD, 8GB RAM, Nvidia Quadro 1000M GPU and is running 64-bit Windows 10.

I trimmed the eight clips down to about 7 minutes and trimmed the music to match. Other than the transitions, I added no other effects.  It took about 12 minutes to encode the video to a full-HD MP4 at 30fps.  Although the fan kicked on, it didn't seem to burden down my PC and the temperature hit a max of 126 degrees F while encoding. The end result was very good with clear video and sound and no dropped frames or other issues.

Usability is straightforward although those familiar with this type of video editing software will be up and running a little quicker than those coming from programs like the newer versions of iMovie.

Videostudio X9 meets my needs which are admittedly fairly basic.  I can't speak for how it will perform for someone who needs tons of special effects and features but if you need a good capable editor for simple to moderate complexity, it can definitely handle it.  It does so with reasonable resource usage.  My only complaint, which is not unique to this version, are the in-your-face ads to upgrade.  You can click to choose not to show the ads again but it doesn't make it any less annoying.  If someone wanted Ultimate, they would have purchased Ultimate.  They don't need to be bombarded with ads featuring special upgrade pricing for Ultimate after the very first use of Pro.",I'm a big fan of the DRM software and this is the only one that I've found that doesn't make me feel like I need to get rid of all the unnecessary stuff and get rid of the annoying installation errors
version | review | product | number | video | editing | hour | time | buyer | program | make | company | awhile | customer | service | way | operating | system,I got this version of Nero 2014 because I have owned Nero since version 1.  I had read a review that said that their were certain add-ins that installed and couldn't be uninstalled.  I read every popup that has been displayed and have had so such problems.  As for the product.  There are a number of new features one being video editing.  I worked with it for over an hour and found it to be mediocre at best.  This version is good but it basically does what the last versions have done.  I like Nero and use it but the older version was just as good with few add ins.  For the first time buyer I would say this is a really good program for making DVDs and BlueRay and the company has been around for awhile.  As far as customer service goes I can't say since I have never had to use it.

It's a breeze to set up, and just as easy to use.  Most all the features are configured for you right out of the box, and the features operate in the background, even the updates.  But there is a serious Achilles' heel for AVG. I'm always sensitive to resource usage of programs, especially multi-tasking programs like this one, and that's is where the AVG Suite falls behind.  Ten separate AVG processes are running in Task Manager, and the system speed slowed considerably.

So, you have a laptop computer and you need a GPS for your car. Hey! For way less than $100 I can get this piece of software and get going somewhere. I'll have all sorts of travel info and map guidance and it'll be great.  Not so fast Sparky....

First you need a peppy laptop. Otherwise you'll be waiting a long time as it grinds out your information. That's your laptop, you say. Good, so let's go. This program installs and updates just fine. Now take the laptop down to your car. Got an empty seat, cool, we're going it alone. OK you won't really want to ask you passenger to have a laptop on their lap all trip long, right? Next we install the GPS unit and remember to use the enclosed extender. You may, most likely will, need a longer cable so the sensor can rest on the top of the dashboard. Next you program your destination and the GPS acquires satellites and off you go. In a word, clunky. It works but having a laptop on the seat next to you is at the very least DISTRACTING. If you're planning an RV trip and have a full time navigator with you. They can man the computer and help with guidance. Cool, this is for you. For the rest of us a dash mounted GPS is soooo much better.

The product works but I can't recommend it. It's fine for fun mapping, but as an actual vehicle GPS it fails. It's too dangerous to use. Imagine your laptop flying around in your car in the event of an accident. Not good.",I bought thislaptop because it's my personal computer that gets me the most out of my cars when I am traveling.

During that time he became someone who was deeply involved in design decisions that were made before new construction started. Finally becoming a remodeler himself. It is fascinating to see his depth of knowledge transform itself on the screen. He has been using an older version of the top Chief Architect program, version 9.5 with a hefty price tag. With this newer version, albeit a junior version of their flagship product, shows many advances over the old full version of the program. He didn't need to draw up blueprints because when it got to the point that additions were being built, he would hire a licensed architect to take his plans and finalize them for approval.
When I showed him this program, in no time at all he was creating multi-room dwellings completely furnished etc. He wants to use it for his remodeling business. Bringing a finished photograph of the remodeling changes was an excellent customer exciter. He had that feature in the old program but it also included ""ray trace"" which was a photo enhancer to make photographs appear more lifelike. He was using Chief Architect 9.5 before. In addition this designer 10 does not have the same sophisticated CAD program. For example if you wanted to show the detail in the foundation, for example the size of the individual block, and components. Even with all that in mind, he loves the program for his day to day business.
Personally I found the tutorial videos very informative, and enabled me to start creating rooms, laying out the outer walls. There are a lot of automatic functions that make it easier for the novice. I am also very excited about the features included in the program including landscaping and decks. What blew my mind was the option of planting a wide array of bushes, and then with a click or two you could determine what they would look like when they were more mature. What a great way to make smart landscaping choices. The amount of detail that the landscaping function includes with all of the different plant species.
This is a great program. Download the trial version and check it out. Highly recommended.",I purchased this for the first time and it was never really practical for me. I had no idea that the home remodeler or broker was involved. He had no idea what I was doing and was happy with the way things were going on in

Learning on the computer has been a new and fairly positive experience for me. The package comes with a number of elements: the base software, the particular language elements to plug into the base software, audio companion CDs for review offline and a USB headset/microphone.

Installation is a two part process, 1) install the base software, 2) install any language element tiers. (The headset will need some installation time, but that should be managed by the system). The installation progressed pretty smooth, took a reasonable amount of time, no errors.

While the process has been much quicker, more of a review, than with the Spanish version, I have followed the lesson plans to get a true feel for the software. Learning is geared toward an immersive process where you start speaking pretty much right at the start (kind of like being tossed into the pool and told to swim). You start by selecting your goals (read, write, speak, etc.) and then follow the lesson plan, reviewing as often as necessary. My personal experience has been that I enjoy the immersive process, I am still working through the lessons, but I fell that I have gained considerably more than I have in past language learning opportunities. The process has been a fairly painless process, and I devote time when available.

My bottom line is that the product is pretty pricey, but gives you one of the best learning experiences I can imagine short of being dropped off in Paris.

Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.

TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 515MB of HD space PLUS up to 1.5GB more if Microsoft .NET 4 is not installed (Mac is only 330MB). Wow! That could be over 2GB of HD to do taxes (last year it was over 1GB). How inefficient we have become!

Fortunately the system requirements says it works on 64-bit systems, and now it specifically mentions Windows 7 64-bit as well as Vista. When I installed it on my Win 7 64-bit machine, installation (mid Jan 2012) seemed to go well without any problems. When it checked for updates, it found 4 updates at 13.2MB and they all seemed to install properly... so no major install issues for me (unlike 2 years ago), however I did have a minor issue. I accidentally canceled the initial updates because the program responded slowly when I clicked the Update button and so I clicked it again. The problem was by the time my 2nd click ""registered"", Turbotax had changed the button to a 'Cancel' button. No big deal though but a little annoying.

NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.

I will update this review as I continue to use the product.

Pros:
* Price includes federal E-File
* Overall, probably the best tax program there is
* Does not say it works on Windows XP 64-bit (but does with 32-bit XP with SP 3+)
* Works on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Vista and Windows 7
* Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition
* Claims ""100% guaranteed accurate calculations""

Cons:
* Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)?
* Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets
* Might take over 2GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements

Other:
* Their marketing continues to be ""guide you step-by-step like a GPS"" to get your max refund... hope it doesn't make mistakes like my GPS does sometimes! But they seem to have toned it down this year (good if you ask me).

Old review:

This review is for TuboTax 2009 Deluxe for Federal Returns. Fortunately I live in Texas and there is no state income tax so I don't have to worry about the state portion.

TurboTax has had its share of issues but I came back to it because it does seem to be the best there is, but I'm knocking off a star because of the history of issues I've had with the program in previous years (like it not calculating tax correctly until I deleted some assets and then re-entered them). However, I was a little shocked to read that it requires 500MB of HD space PLUS up to 620MB more if Microsoft .NET 3.5 SP1 is not installed (Mac is only 255MB). Wow! That could be over 1GB to do taxes. How inefficient we have become!

I just installed TurboTax Fed Deluxe on a Vista x64 system (it's Jan 7th, 2010) and didn't have any problems. In fact, it installed very quickly considering that it claims it needs 500MB (but I do have an SSD drive that greatly speeds things up). TurboTax immediately found 4 updates and asked me if I wanted to update. The updates seemed to have installed just fine. ""Uninstall or change a programs"" says TurboTax 2009 is using 343MB. It says TurboTax 2008 (from last year and still on my computer) is ""only"" 162MB, so a BIG increase (but I wonder how accurate are these figures?). In any case, even 1GB of space is not a big requirement nowadays.

I will be working with this to help estimate my 2009 taxes before I pay may Jan 15th estimated tax payment.

NOTE: Deluxe will do a Schedule C just fine, but it may not provide as much help as the Home & Business version. If you have been doing taxes yourself for awhile then you might not need to pay the extra money for the additional help.

I will update this review as I continue to use the product.

Pros:
* Works on 64-bit versions of Windows XP and higher (of course that includes Vista and Windows 7)
* On Jan 8th, I used it to help compute an estimate of the tax I will owe for 2009 to help determine what to pay for my last 2009 estimated tax payment and the program did not crash.
* I had a ""flawless"" install and update on Vista 64-bit - didn't ask for any serial or reg code
* Probably the best tax program there is
* Price includes federal E-File
* Deluxe version can do a Schedule C for the self-employed - but it doesn't provide as much guidance as the Home & Business edition

Cons:
* Not perfect (but how can US taxes ever be perfect)?
* Annoying ""smart"" input entries that try to format things like dates while you're still entering them
* Bad/complicated handling of SEP contributions
* Have encountered bugs in previous years that caused me to have to delete and re-enter assets
* Doesn't jive well with multi-monitors - it likes to pop up windows on various monitors instead of staying on the same monitor
* Might take up to 1.12GB of HD space on Windows according to the system requirements","I was reviewing the reviews for this model and found that the IRS had a significant share in the income tax portion of my paycheck, and I did not feel the need to pay full tax, since my income from that state was not covered by"

I've used McAfee in the past and it seems as if its really trying to be competitive with this 2016 version of the Anti-Virus software.

There is no CD which I like. The last thing I need is another CD. Rather there is a card with a security key that allows you to download the software from the website. Of course, you'll need to create a McAfee account if you don't already have one.

Some of the features this software claims to have are:

Supports Windows 10, 8.1, 8 and 7
Windows - blocks viruses, malware, ransomware (this is a new one for me), spyware, unwanted programs, wi-fi protection, web safety, PC Optimization tools, anti-spam and parental controls and file protection

Mac & IOS = 10.8 or higher - anti-malware, firewall, network manager, web safety tools for MACs and anti-theft, file protection for iOS tablets and smartphones
True Key Identify Manager - Quickly and easily log in to sites, apps, and more using facial  recognition for up to 5 user accounts

Android devices - 4.0 and higher - Data backup, anti-theft, app privacy, and wi-fi protection for tablets and smart phones
Privacy Protection - Privacy, encrypt files stored on PCs

Free Support - Technical support, security advisers, and customer service available for the life of your subscription

Security Management Console - Check security status of all devices, remote location, lock and wipe your lost or stolen tablet or smart phone.

This is a 1-year subscription. A couple of red flags, one being that this product claims to protect all your devices, but only 5 User Accounts. My household has 3 PCS, 3 Laptops, 3 Tablets and 3 Cell phones. Also, this software claims to offer a lot and I can't properly review what it actually does until I actually install it in January, when my Norton subscription expires. One of the reasons I went from McAfee to Norton is because even though McAfee made some great claims, I was still affected by a virus, the apps associated with the virus are very intrusive especially on my Galaxy Note, that I had to uninstall it.

I will provide an update when I install this software. But it is important to remember that with the increasingly savvy techniques from hackers and other people who have nothing better to do than destroy your expensive computer equipment, that it is possible for any anti-virus software not to be 100% effective. It's also important to use common sense.",I have had a couple of incidents in the past where I tried to get rid of the malware and ransomware.

It came with a license to use it on three computers. My husband and I were both impressed with what the program said it could do. It sounded too good to be true. We installed it on two desktop PCs and one laptop.

All the computers were slowed down to a snail's pace. Starting up the computer took at least three minutes (and seemed like a lifetime). Opening each program took so long, minutes to open an application!  Opening my (popular) email application and waiting for the download to happen took forever. The process by which it scans each email for viruses apparently takes a lot of time. To cope I'd end up opening the program, walking away and returning later to read the email.

Even using the computer doing simple tasks like changing to view the email program to use a word processing program was very difficult. I'd click on the other application and it would pause and nothing would move, then a minute or two later the screen would finally react. Flipping from one Internet browser to another would have long pauses and it `wouldn't go'.  Before installing this program I could flip to different Internet browser windows with immediate results. Trying to open new programs such as a spreadsheet program took forever and the cursor didn't seem to react, so I'd click on the icon again. In the end sometimes I'd end up with three of the programs open and ready to run.

I had the worst experience with using a (popular) photo altering program. That program kept locking up.

The long time that it took to access different programs and to switch from viewing the Internet to the word processor made the most basic computer work painstaking and time consuming. It was ridiculous. I have not experienced a computer being this way since the early 1990s when I was accessing the Internet through dial-up! To cope with the computer being this way, I took to reading something on paper while I waited for the system to catch up so I could do whatever it was that I was trying to do.

Also when starting up the system each day I'd get an urgent message that there was a problem! Guess what `the problem'  was? I had new documents that needed backing up. Give me a break--that is no urgent or emergency situation.

We were so happy to uninstall this from all of our computers. Now are computers are back to normal.

We did spend quite a lot of time installing this program and then uninstalling it. What a waste of time this was. I can't believe how poor this program is, I'm really surprised.

If I had paid money for this I'd be irate about it! I got it free from the Amazon Vine program so all that was wasted was our time.","I was using this program for several years and found helpful.

Not only is this an impressive, powerful suite of graphics design tools, Corel doesn't throw you under the bus as soon as you install the software.  If you're like me and don't have a single artistic bone in your body (I can't draw a straight line with a ruler), you would expect a fancy-pants software package like this to leave you dumbfounded from the start, with no clue on how to get started.  Much to their credit, Corel throws you lifelines as soon as you jump in the pool and makes a diverse set of rescue resources near at hand for you at all times.  I'm not saying you'll be a graphics design guru after a couple of hours - this is a really advanced,  powerful set of programs here - but you would have a hard time finding a piece of software with more impressive built-in support.  The first of several excellent video tutorials is available on the Welcome screen, and you can choose to have a built-in docket of usage tips available for every function you choose.  Users of previous versions of the software will have no problem recognizing the changes this upgrade brings with it, as you can choose to have every single change and addition from your previous version highlighted on the screen.  That doesn't sound like much, but it is a big help.  You also have What's New and Learning Tools readily available to you from the Welcome screen as well as from inside each of the featured programs.  Of course, you also have a complete help file available but you won't need to resort to using that very often.

As I'm sure you can tell by the price, you don't buy this program if you just want to take the redeye out of your vacation photos or create a cute little Christmas card to send to friends.  You can certainly do those things with this, but Corel Photo-Paint X4, impressive as it is, is overshadowed by the primary CorelDRAW application.  (If all you want is a powerful photo editor, I would still recommend Fireworks - my favorite - or Photoshop.)  I would like to have seen a few more built-in templates included, but CorelDRAW actually succeeds in making graphics design possible for even artistically inept folks like me.  This is one powerful program which actual graphics professionals should take to like fish to water.  Professionals may be the primary target audience for this software package, but Corel does a great job of making these powerful tools available and actually useable by anyone.

I also have to mention several additional software applications and features included in this suite deal.  Corel PowerTRACE X4 is of enormous help in turning traced bitmaps into images you can convert into editable vector images.  Corel CAPTURE X4, as you might guess, is a powerful screen capture utility.  The Bitstream Font Navigator is a comprehensive font manager that even helps you identity scanned fonts from an outside source.  You even get a Duplexing Wizard to aid you in optimizing the appearance of your document when printing two-sided copies.  Vista users will also welcome the integration of this software package with the Vista operating system, as the search and preview options by themselves should be of great convenience to them.

What about file formats and the age-old question of compatibility?  After all, the odds are that some if not many of your associates are working with different file formats in non-Corel software.  Well, Corel has worked to make CorelDRAW Graphic Suite X4 software as compatible as possible with other users and systems.  In this release, the list of additional new formats includes Word and Publisher 2007, AutoCAD DXF and AutoCAD DWG, and Adobe CS3.

I could go on writing paragraph after paragraph about this product, but I could never begin to describe all of its many impressive features.  Is it the best graphics design software on the market?  I don't know, as I have no experience using any comparable graphics design programs.  Even if I had, I don't think anyone short of a professional graphics designer would be able to judge the comparative pros and cons.  What I do know is that anyone who is serious about graphics design in any of its various facets would do well to give CorelDRAW Graphic Suite X4 a long and serious look.",I've been using this for the past 20+ years and I was first introduced to it in Madera in the early 90's and for some years had them ship me the software until I found a way to order in the U

 If you are already running version X4, the new features of X5 include a new ""Places"" Map mode with GoogleMaps integration that reads the GPS data your camera records as Exif information, the ability to organize photos using facial recognition into ""People"" groupings, enhancements to the ""Exposure Merge"" HDR tool including a single-RAW HDR mode, a new ""Graduated Filter"" effect, a new ""Retro Lab"" to give photos a vintage look, a new ""Instant Effects"" pop-up palette that lets you quickly try out many preset effects on a photo, better support for importing Adobe Photoshop brushes, the ability to run several scripts in sequence for batch processing of photos, and enhanced social media integration.
 PaintShop Pro has a very wide range of tools for both photo editing and graphic design, ranging from serious photography-specific tools to fun graphics manipulation.
 It combines photo editing, photo retouching, painting, drawing, graphics design, and image management in a single package.
 There are a great selection of photo enhancement tools, both to fix common photography issues and also more esoteric image manipulation tools.
 It also includes Web graphics tools for image mapping and slicing, and for coding image rollovers and Web button creation.
 This is very affordable, yet very powerful, currently selling on Amazon at a heavily discounted pricing of less than $50.
 It has a very useful ""Learning Center"" and video tutorials help photo-editing newbies learn the software and accomplish common tasks.
 The user interface is divided into three tabs, ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"", providing a usable workflow from initial photo review to final editing, and allowing you to configure, customize, and save how you use each workspace. You can also customize each toolbar individually.

 Negatives:

 In spite of many improvement over the years, PaintShop Pro still lacks an automated tool for stitching together overlapping adjacently-photographed photos to create panoramas.
 Even though the HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool works fairly well, the tool is not always precise at aligning objects between bracketed shots and it is especially lacking in deghosting; both problems can arise from either camera movement or movement of objects in the scene.
 It has limited RAW file processing capabilities and compatibilities compared to Adobe Lightroom, but Corel intends for RAW handling to be better addressed in their AfterShot Pro software.
 As with some of Corel's other recent products, accessing the help documentation requires access to Corel's online Web site for information, instead of being able to access all help documentation locally on my computer directly from within the application.
 Despite being more uncluttered and streamlined than the previous X3 version's user interface, the ""Edit"" tab of this new user interface that was introduced in X4, which serves as the main workhorse for serious image editing, is still somewhat cluttered and disorganized, with overlapping functions and ambiguous groupings of tools, and this impacts the ergonomics and usability of the software, especially for new users.
 For the graphics newbie who has no previous experience using graphics software, there is a medium-to-high learning curve effort required to learn how to proficiently use the software. This software is not specifically designed for simple image manipulation by novices. If you are initially learning this software, you should start off just using the ""Adjust"" tab and not use the ""Edit"" tab; the ""Adjust"" tab is simplified and suitable to novices whereas the ""Edit"" tab is meant for power users.
 This is just a small nitpick, but this is a far smaller upgrade if you are upgrading from X4 to this X5 than compared to if you upgraded from X3 to X4.

I have always been a fan of PaintShop Pro throughout the 1990s and I have often kept updating PSP versions after Corel acquired its original developer, JASC Software, in 2004, even though I also have been updating versions of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite starting from CorelDRAW 5. Along with recently releasing ""Corel AfterShot Pro"" (after Corel acquired Bibble Labs and repackaged their ""Bibble Pro"" as ""AfterShot Pro"") and including Corel's original ""Photo-Paint"" photo-editor as part of the ""CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6"", Corel now has three photo applications which have some overlapping functions and also unique abilities of their own. As a photo management application, AfterShot Pro is meant to complement PSP and compete against Adobe Photoshop Lightroom. I previously used both of Corel's PaintShop Pro and Corel's Photo-Paint software for photo editing, and even though recent versions of PaintShop Pro run slower than Photo-Paint due to code bloat from an ever-increasing set of features, PaintShop Pro remains my favorite ""Photoshop for the non-professional-graphics masses"" application, being more feature-packed and capable like Photoshop CS than Adobe's own Photoshop Elements 11.

What is in the box package of this PaintShop Pro X5 Ultimate edition?

 PaintShop Pro X5 software CD (for Windows 8/7/Vista/XP)
 A second ""Ultimate Pack"" CD with Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0, FaceFilter Studio 2, and a ""Creative Collection"" of royalty-free stock photos, and dozens of brushes, textures, and presets
 223-page User Guide

The PSP X5 product features are described and rated below:

 Design & Features:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating:

 After Corel acquired JASC Software, they have been adding new features with each release, and even though this version runs and feels slower than earlier versions of PSP, I feel that it is a fair trade-off to allow the code bloat due to the number and complexity of features to slow the software down. With this latest X5 version, I get a powerful set of photo and graphics editing tools that is more useful than Photoshop Elements 11. PSP X5 pales in comparison to the power of the full-blown Photoshop CS, but with its significantly lower pricing and learning curve compared to Photoshop CS, it is obviously meant to compete against software like Photoshop Elements, which it handily outperforms. The rich set of tools included in PSP range from very specific goal-oriented adjustments like the ""Selective Focus"" tool that simulates the effect of tilt-shift lenses to tools that are very friendly to use by newbies such as 'One Step Photo Fix', 'Smart Photo Fix', and 'One Step Noise Removal'. This ""Ultimate"" version of PSP X5 adds even more power and value by including the award-winning Nik Color Efex Pro 3.0 photographic filters, which includes 52 photographic filters that can be applied to images to give them special effects. The ""Ultimate"" version also includes Reallusion's ""FaceFilter Studio 2"", which lets you digitally give a face-lift to portraits, change facial expressions, smooth out wrinkles and skin blemishes, and perform operations that professional editors use to make fashion models look perfect in magazine ads. Also included in this Ultimate version is a ""Creative Collection"", which has more than 100 royalty-free stock photos and over 25 unique brushes, and dozens of new textures and presets.

When installing the ""FaceFilter Studio 2"" application from the CD, if the installation procedure rejects your entered serial number, do not include the preceding ""SKRRFF2"" when entering the FaceFilter serial number.

 Along with the ""Effect Browser"" that was introduced with the previous X4 version, this X5 version now includes a new ""Instant Effects"" palette. There seems to be a confusing overlap between both the ""Effect Browser"" menu options and the ""Instant Effects"" palette options. Both options help you navigate through the plethora of tools and effects, instead of accessing each effect one by one. The dialog box window for the ""Effect Browser"" has not been updated to match the stylish user interface, and it still has the old Windows-expanding-folder-tree appearance of old PSP versions, while the ""Instant Effects"" palette matches the look-and-feel of other palette options. The ""Effect Browser"" displays thumbnails of the actual image that you are editing, with each effect applied to the thumbnail image, whereas the ""Instant Effects"" displays the same example thumbnails instead of showing you a thumbnail of what each effect would look like using your own image. I do like the ""Effect Browser"" approach of applying the effect on my own image instead of the new ""Instant Effects"" display of generic thumbnail images though. The ""Effect Browser"" also groups the effects by tool type (e.g. ""Blur"", ""Color"", ""Hue and Saturation"", ""Sharpness""), while the ""Instant Effects"" palette groups the effects by image style (e.g. ""Black and White"", ""Film Styles"", ""Landscape"", ""Portrait"").

 The previous X4 version introduced the HDR (High Dynamic Range) ""Exposure Merge"" tool that is Corel's foray into HDR software, which Adobe and other graphics software vendors are also incorporating into their tools. HDR processing involves combining multiple exposures of the exact same shot (which is easier if your camera has an Automatic Exposure Bracketing (AEB) function) to create a high dynamic range photo which can display a higher tonal range than what the camera is capable of capturing in a single exposure. There are various software specifically dedicated to HDR processing. For the past five years, since version 3 in 2008, I have been using the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Photomatix-Pro-4/dp/B002CIP12U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Photomatix Pro 4</a>&nbsp;software for HDR processing. This X5 version of ""Exposure Merge"" adds new black-and-white HDR controls and a very useful ""Preview Alignment"" option to visually inspect the positioning of your merged photos. There is also a new ""single RAW photo"" option where you can create an HDR photo using a single RAW image by defining an ""EV Interval"" to simulate a triple-bracketed shot, and the software will then split the single RAW image into three exposures before combining them together. This single-shot-HDR option is also offered by both ""Photomatix"" and ""DxO Optics Pro"" software.

On a relative scale specifically rating its HDR functions, I would rate Photomatix 5 fuzzy stars while this PSP X5's HDR ""Exposure Merge"" tool only gets 3.5 fuzzy stars rating. This X5 ""Exposure Merge"" is improved over the X4 version, which I would rate at 3.0 stars. But both Corel and Adobe still have a long way to catch up with the powerful and flexible offerings in Photomatix. In particular, I found the ""Exposure Merge"" tool in PSP to be lacking in its ability to precisely align bracketed photos and thoroughly and flexibly remove ghosting artifacts, which is something that Photomatix does a very good job at. If you use a tripod-mounted camera to shoot bracketed photos where nothing in the scene moves the least bit, then the ""Exposure Merge"" tool consistently outputs good HDR results. But when shooting portraits or landscapes, or shooting hand-held, bracketed photos often have misaligned objects and/or moving objects in the shots. Even bracketed portrait shots of a person using a tripod can result in tiny movements by the person that require excellent alignment and deghosting by HDR software, and Photomatix currently beats PSP's ""Exposure Merge"" tool in this area. PSP's ""Exposure Merge"" tool frequently has ghosting artifacts leftover either from movement of the camera by the photographer or movement of objects in the scene. This ghosting is especially evident in scenes such as landscapes where various plants may be moving in the breeze or portraits where the subject has slightly moved in between each bracketed shot. Photomatix also includes a plethora of other tone mapping, image stacking, and on-the-fly editing adjustments, including being able to define specific areas of photos to deghost and specific areas of photos where I can use the original image instead of the HDR output. I use these Photomatix functions a lot because I always aim for very natural-looking HDR images, instead of the surreal psychedelic HDR images that are, all too often, output by people. HDR software can be abused to create unnatural over-saturated photos that become tiresome to look at. Using Photomatix on an image of people set against a beautiful background landscape, I can tell the software to use an original un-HDR'ed exposure of a photo for the people's faces while letting the software HDR-process the rest of the landscape, and this is very useful to me because HDR-processed skin tones can sometimes look unnatural. PSP's ""Exposure Merge"" tool cannot perform these functions that I described. So a good HDR workflow would be to HDR-process your bracketed photos first using Photomatix, and then further edit the HDR output in PSP, perhaps performing some sharpening as the last step before saving the files.

 PSP X5 include a new ""Places"" Map mode with GoogleMaps integration that reads the GPS data your camera records as Exif information. This helps you map your photos and you can manually add location information by drag-and-dropping photos onto a map, or by using GPS data or Facebook check-in points. The ""Places"" section also lets you organize your photos based on location groupings.

 Related to the GoogleMaps integration in X5, there is a new ""Share My Trip"" project option that lets you use location information to place your vacation photos on an interactive map. You can share your map as a slideshow which you can post on a blog or upload directly to your Dropbox or Facebook account.

 X5 has enhanced social media integration, which lets you upload photos simultaneously to your Facebook, Flickr, and Google+ accounts. This sharing functionality was introduced in version X4, and has been expanded for X5.

 Similar to the ""Places"" groupings, you can now organize photos using the software's facial recognition ability into ""People"" groupings.

 There is a new and really cool ""Retro Lab"" that lets you apply effects that were inspired by vintage-style pocket cameras such as LOMO, Diana, or Holga. This trendy photo style pushes an image's color and contrast beyond its natural appearance, often with blurred or vignette edges. More than just a collection of single-click filters, ""Retro Lab"" also lets you personalize your own retro style and you can save your settings as a custom preset for future use.

 A new ""Graduated Filter"" effect in the ""Photo Effects"" menu lets you apply a semi-transparent color gradient to your photos which simulates the effect of using a graduated filter on a camera lens. For example, you can darken or tint a sky that appears washed out without affecting other areas of the photo. There are four gradient styles, a color picker, and opacity, blend, and rotation controls.

 The ""Layers"" palette now includes a [Layer Styles] button, making it easier to access and apply Bevel, Drop Shadow, Emboss, Inner Glow, Outer Glow, and Reflection styles. New controls for size, opacity, and color can be adjusted for each Layer Style.

 If you use PSP's scripting abilities to automate common workflows, X5 adds a new ""Run Multiple Scripts"" option that lets you chain together multiple scripts to run in sequence. This is a very handy option that I use a lot!

 Various other incremental improvements have been added to this X5 version. The ""Crop"" tool now has a rule-of-thirds grid and presets for common image sizes. The ""Text"" tool works better and more intuitively with the ""Pick"" tool for quicker and more accurate positioning of text; text positioning was sometimes a source of irritation for me in the previous X3 and X4 versions.

 Although Corel hopes that users perform RAW conversion using their ""AfterShot Pro"" software (which was formerly ""Bibble Pro"" before Corel acquired Bibble Labs), PSP X5 still includes its ""Camera RAW Lab"" for RAW conversion. The previous X4 version added useful highlight recovery options to recover details in overexposed regions of a photo. But, unfortunately, this X5 version has no improvements to the ""Camera RAW Lab"".

 Ergonomics, Usability & Ease of Use:  Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies rating

 Introduced in the previous X4 version, the user interface has three separate, yet integrated, workflow interfaces, designated by tabs across the top of the program window: ""Manage"", ""Adjust"", ""Edit"". The ""Photo Organizer"" in previous versions is now replaced by an ""Organizer"" palette which is available from all three workflow tabs.

 The ""Manage"" tab is where you browse, review, and rate images, edit metadata, and create collections of photos. This workspace lets you review and organize your photo files. Using the navigation palette, you can select an entire photo folder on your computer, narrow the selection according to one or more tags that you have assigned to photos, or narrow the selection according to the ratings that you have assigned to photos. The palette also shows basic Exif information about a photo.

 The ""Adjust"" tab is where you can make photo adjustments using a subset of the most common tools such as sharpening, color balance, brightness/contrast, fill light, clarity, tone mapping, noise removal, cropping, straightening, red-eye removal, or using its various built-in touch-up tools. Edits can also be applied to batches of files. This tab only offers a portion of the tools that are all available from the ""Edit"" tab. Its interface is cleaner and far less busy than the ""Edit"" tab, and because of its simpler layout, it makes an ideal interface for beginning users who are just starting to learn the software.

 The ""Edit"" tab includes all of the entire sets of tools for photo editing, drawing, painting, and graphic design work. By contrast, the ""Adjust"" tab offers only a subset of what can be accessed from the ""Edit"" tab. I think of the ""Adjust"" tab as being designed for novice newbies and beginning-intermediate levels of users, who often are not exactly sure what is wrong with their photo and how specifically to correct/adjust it, and the ""Edit"" tab is designed for advanced power users like me who want to have direct access to all the tools. If you are just starting out with graphics software, I recommend that you begin your photo editing from the ""Adjust"" tab, and then later as you become more proficient with the software, you can ignore this tab and always proceed directly to the ""Edit"" tab. The ""Adjust"" tab is much cleaner with its presentation of tools grouped into a handful of categories on the left side of the user interface and four menu options along the top, whereas the ""Edit"" tab lets you access every possible tool in its comprehensive tool chest and eleven menu options along the top. Overall, I think that this three-tab design strikes a happy balance that addresses the needs of both new users and power users.

 While the ""Manage"" and ""Adjust"" tabs are more simpler, clean, and organized in their user interface layouts, the ""Edit"" tab feels very busy and crowded, and it can be hard to find tools, especially when you are initially familiarizing yourself with all of the software's dozens of tools. And to add to this ergonomics and usability issue, the main menu on the ""Edit"" tab divides the tools into two menu options: 'Adjust' and 'Effects'. The ""Adjust"" tab includes a subset of options that are listed under the 'Adjust' menu option on the ""Edit"" tab. One ambiguous example is that under the 'Adjust' main menu option of the ""Edit"" tab, there is a 'Brightness and Contrast' option that then opens up a submenu containing the 'Fill Light/Clarity' tool. But the 'Adjust' menu also lists a similar tool called 'Fill Flash'. Both the 'Fill Light/Clarity' and 'Fill Flash' tools have a similar function, but neither the printed User Manual nor the online ""Help Topics"" documentation explain what the differences between both tools are. At a minimum, the 'Fill Flash' tool also needs to be moved into the submenu below the 'Brightness and Contrast' option. Ideally, both 'Fill Flash', which has 'Strength' and 'Saturation' slider settings, and 'Fill Light/Clarity', which has 'Fill Light' and 'Clarity' slider settings, should be combined into a single tool window containing three or four sliders, instead of confusing users as to which of these two tools to use.

 The software links to a variety of searchable online help and built-in tutorials. As with some of their other recent software releases, including the previous PSP X4, Corel has the help documentation in this PSP X5 set up so that clicking on the 'Help' option from the menu and then selecting 'Help Topics' starts up your browser and takes you to Corel's Web site where all of the help topics are accessible online and can also be searched. I really wished that Corel gave the user the option, during the initial software CD installation process, to either install the entire help documentation locally on the computer or to link the software to Corel's online Web site. After all, being dependent upon online access in order to access help information can be problematic if the user needs to search the 'Help Topics' from a place where there is no Internet access. On October 2 2012, Corel released a 76-MB 'PSPX5_LocalHelp.exe' patch that does install all of the help files locally on the computer, but after I installed this patch, clicking the 'Help Topics' still always brings up my browser and opens up a new Web page to display Corel's online help content. And there does not seem to be a way to configure PSP X5 to default to offline mode and use the locally-installed help files even when no Internet connection is available. But you can still manually access the locally-installed help files by directly pointing your browser at the directory path where all of the help files are installed. The main Web page for the help files is located in the directory path below:

32-bit C:\Program Files\Corel\Corel PaintShop Pro X5\Languages\EN\Help\wwhelp\wwhimpl\js\html\wwhelp.htm
64-bit: C:\Program Files (x86)\Corel\Corel PaintShop Pro X5\Languages\EN\Help\wwhelp\wwhimpl\js\html\wwhelp.htm

If your PSP install also constantly redirects you to Corel's Web site after installing the help files locally, you can point your Web browser to this location to access the locally-installed help files. This locally-installed help documentation page, complete with a search function, works well using either Internet Explorer or Safari browsers, but Firefox just displays a blank two-framed page.

 My one main gripe about this and all previous versions of PSP is that it still does not have a tool for stitching together panoramic photos. Photoshop has the ""Photomerge"" utility and Canon has ""PhotoStitch"" for creating panorama photos. But PaintShop Pro and also Corel's Photo-Paint in their Graphics Suite package have been missing this very useful functionality for a long time. Corel really needs to add a panorama merge/stitch function to their ever-increasing rich set of tools. The current way to create a panoramic photo in PSP is an entirely manual and laborious process. You first create a new canvas that is large enough to hold all of the expected overlapping photos, you then copy each photo into a separate layer, decrease the opacity of one layer so you can see through it while you manually move the layer around to visually align the edges of one photo with the overlapping portion of another photo, and you repeat this tedious process for all overlapping photos that will be used in the panorama before setting the layers' opacities back to 100%. Needless to say, this is both time-consuming and highly prone to error, and the manually merged result only works if you shot the overlapping photos using a tripod with a panning head and a very level camera. By comparison, Canon's ""PhotoStitch"" program is very user-friendly and flexible with its options, and it automatically aligns and merges photos in the order that you specify.

 Performance, Stability, Reliability:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 Compared to previous versions of PSP, this X5 version has pretty good stability. During almost one year of weekly usage before writing this review, I have had the software crash or hang about 3 or 4 times total, and this includes running the software on an old underpowered Windows Vista laptop and a tiny Windows 7 Dell Mini 10 netbook. Corel has obviously worked on adding stability with this version, along with GPU optimizations.

 Speed has been noticeably improved, the performance is considerably faster than previous versions, start-up time to launch the program for the first time has been improved, and these improvements are especially apparent when running PSP X5 on an older slower computer. When used on my 5-year old Windows Vista laptop with 2GB memory, applying most effects happens in real-time, and for some operations such as adjusting sharpening parameters on 100-MB TIFF image files, the pop-up preview window will still display a progress meter, but these progress meters only last for a few seconds on this older laptop of mine.

 This X5 version uses less than 400 MB of disk space on a full install. The previous X4 version used about 900 MB of disk space, and version X3 required 3GB of disk space, which tells me that prior to X4, PSP had become very bloated and disorganized. So this redesign both increased performance and reduced the disk space required. By comparison, Adobe's Photoshop Elements 11 requires a whopping 3GB to 4GB of disk space, even though it has less features and effects than PSP.

 Competitive Pricing & Value:  Excellent 5-fuzzies rating

 At the time of this review's writing, PaintShop Pro X5 Ultimate is being discounted on Amazon at a price less than $50, and its price is less than Amazon's price for Photoshop Elements 11, even though PSPX4 is a more capable and better program! With the Amazon discounting, this is truly a bargain for the amount of photo and graphics editing power that you get.

 Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:

For overall bang-for-the-buck combination of very affordable value and feature-packed power in a commercial photo-editing software package, this PSP X5 currently reigns supreme, beating out Adobe Photoshop Elements 11 and all other photo-editing software that I can think of. If you want something even less expensive, look into a freeware graphics software called ""GIMP"" which offers a ton of graphics editing power for free. And if you have no experience with graphics software or if you do not want to spend time learning its complexities, look into the free and easy-to-use software called ""Paint. NET"".

Despite the significant performance improvements in versions X4 and X5 (they are roughly 50% to 100% faster than X3 and also far more stable), it still does have its slow areas of laggardly performance. In particular, this is not a good software for processing RAW files, both due to its slow RAW converter and due to its limited RAW compatibility.

If you want the deluxe photo management and editing solution, deluxe in capability, cost, and complexity, using Adobe's Lightroom and Photoshop CS are the way to go. Otherwise, this PSP X5 is an excellent ""Photoshop for the masses"" alternative. If you primarily shoot in RAW, adding Corel's AfterShot Pro allows for great RAW handling followed by photo editing in PSP X5. And if Corel's HDR feature in PSP X5 has whetted your appetite for HDR processing, you should seriously consider getting Photomatix Pro (currently at version 4) since its capabilities exceed anything that Corel or Adobe has to offer.

If you are using a version of PaintShop Pro prior to X4, is this PSP X5 worth the upgrade?

Most definitely! There were many dozens of improvements in going from X3 to X4. Even if you ignore all of its new features and enhancements, just the fact that X4 and X5 run a lot faster and are more stable than X3 is a compelling enough reason to upgrade. However, the improvements in going from X4 to X5 are more incremental; there were far more improvements in going from X3 to X4. But with a good discounted price, it is still worthy upgrading from X4 to X5.

If you are just starting out with photo-editing, should you buy this PSP X5 or Adobe Photoshop Elements 11?

I feel that PSP X5 is a far more capable and feature-rich program than Adobe Photoshop Elements 11. PSP X5 is more like the full-blown Photoshop CS version than APE11. APE11 includes more built-in layer styles that PSP X5 does not have, although if you are just starting out, you will not miss this. Once you become proficient in PSP X5, you can create your own styles and record them as scripts to repeatedly reuse. Photoshop Elements has a much larger user base than PSP, and there are numerous sites to download brushes and textures from, but it is easy to convert Photoshop brushes to use in PSP, so that is not really a problem. APE11 has more adjustment brushes than PSP X5 when it comes to brushing on effects like dodge, burn, and saturation. But PSP X5 has more artistic tools than APE11, useful for painting, drawing, scrapbooking, and graphic design, and PSP X5 is more useful and flexible for manipulating images other than photos than APE11. PSP X5 requires less than one third the disk space to install than APE11, and at the time of this review's writing, Amazon has it priced lower than APE11, even though PSP X5 is far more packed with features. But... if you think that you will eventually migrate up to Photoshop CS, which is far more complex, powerful, and expensive, then starting out with APE11 will give you skills that are more transferable to Photoshop CS than becoming proficient with PSP X5.

One final note: On August 2013, Corel released a ""Service Pack 3"" patch that provides various enhancements and bug fixes. After installing PaintShop Pro X5 on your computer, you can either download this 98-MB executable from Corel's Web site, or from the user interface, click 'Help' and ""Check for Updates"" to download and install the service pack that way. You should definitely install this service pack .","iMac Lite Professionnel is an automatic retouching tool that enables you to quickly and easily recreate a landscape.

Overall, the interface looks very similar to last year.  I purchased the H&R Deluxe + State, but the Federal portion is identical, so I am reposting the Federal portion of the review for reference here.

I've used H&R Block's tax software (formerly called TaxCut) every year since 1995. Several times when I saw a promotional deal I purchased both H&R Block and TurboTax to compare. I found that both programs satisfied my needs but H&R Block costs consistently less. I have been buying the Deluxe version of H&R Block because it covers it the mutual funds sales and cost basis calculations are included (Schedule D) and the form for Foreign Tax Credit from mutual funds is present (Form 1116). To get this functionality in TurboTax you need to buy the Premium version of the software.

The price on this package changes often and you can catch some great discounts. I use a nice tool that shows history of Amazon prices. If you enter ""Amazon price history alert"" in Google it will come up at the top, my favorite has the word ""camel"" (repeated 3 times) in the name. You can set up the tool to send you an alert when you desired price drop is reached. During the last tax year season the price fluctuated between $20 and the list price of $34.99, and was on the gold deal special a couple of times.

' INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
' I had no problems with my install. However in 2013 I helped a friend resolve an install problem on a Windows 8 PC us installing from a CD. I am including what we did again as I know a few people told me in helped with 2014 install. Normally the automatic install runs a file called ""tcauto.exe"". This file in turn calls another program located under ""installers"" directory which actually does the work. We were able to by-pass the error by executing the exe program in the installers directory directly, this year it should be called ""HR_Block_Tax_Software_2015_Deluxe__State_-_Windows_CD.exe"" (it is the only file in that directory).

' If you encounter issues with display, such as not seeing selection boxes, check your screen resolution. Both Windows and Mac minimum requirement for the screen resolution is 1024 x 768 pixels or higher. At a lower resolution H&R Block software will have problem with display such as not properly displaying selection boxes. Screen resolution can be changed on your control panel by change PC's display settings.

' If you are using a digital download you will need a key-code to install the software after you download it. The key-code can be located several ways.
Option 1: In the past when my download finished the install started automatically and offered me a choice of two links ""View Keys"" and ""Install"".
Option 2: This year the install did not start automatically so I clicked on the install program myself, and on the first screen it asked for ""Activation code"". When I purchased the software Amazon sent me a message which included a Product Code (note that they did not call it Activation code) which is the number I needed.
Option 3: You can locate it in your Amazon account:
1) Log into Amazon
2) Select Your Account at the top right of the page
3) Select Games and Software downloads which is towards the bottom of the long page you see when you log in
4) Then under H&R software entry you will see the key-code that you need to enter to unlock the software

' If you have a virus scanner it will generate an alert the first time you run the program, change the permission to ""Permit Always"" otherwise the program will be blocked.

' Does H&R allow to install the software on two PCs?
I found the answer on H&R Block web site FAQ under the topic ""Installing Software on Another Computer""
I quote the FAQ answer below:
""There are just a few steps necessary to re-install the H&R Block At Home program from the CD you received in the mail. Follow the steps below to re-install the program or install it on a second computer.
Insert the H&R Block At Home CD into your computer.
Click the Need to Re-install? link on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen.
The Frequently Asked Questions page will open to the first FAQ titled, ""Can I install the software on a second computer?""
Enter your activation code and last 4 digits of the credit card you used to purchase the program initially and click Activate.
You can find your activation code in your purchase confirmation e-mail.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.""

' WHAT IS INCLUDED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I purchased H&R Block Deluxe entitles me to 5 free federal e-files. It allows me to print and mail as many returns as I want, there is no limit on printed returns.

' GENERAL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I just finished my preliminary tax return and below are my observations. Note: the forms are not final until mid January of 2016.

' Pet Peeve: H&R Block starts the interview process with an annoying up-sell pitch, recommending an upgrade from Deluxe to Premium even when it is not necessary. In my opinion, they should wait until the person enters this year's data and suggest the upgrade only if there is something about the return that can benefit from the Premium version. That would have been useful.

What is the difference between Premium and Deluxe? The Premium version offers advanced tools for self-employed and rental property owners: cost basis of home sales, dividends, gifts, and inheritance assets. It has advanced schedule C guidance to maximize deductions for self-employment income. And finally it has guidance for rental property income and expenses. The rest of the Premium package is the same as Deluxe.

Note that the Deluxe package has support for self-employed income as well as stock sale cost basis calculations.

' Pet Peeve: Help is not context sensitive. For example, when you click on ""learn more"" about a particular topic the general help window opens but it does not show help topics for the specific topic that you were working on. Instead you need to search and know which key words to use locate the relevant topics.

' H&R Block provides you some guidance for completing Form 1116 (foreign tax credit, for example foreign tax paid by mutual funds). However, you need to keep switching between whole-form view to enter data and then back to interview to read the instructions. Even though the form where you can enter data is visible at the same time as instructions you cannot enter data into it until you switch into whole-form view. This is cumbersome, but at least there is some guidance for this form.

' DeductionPro (which helps you put value on your charitable donations) is integrated into H&R Block software running on your local PC. It suggests reasonable prices based on condition of the donated item and it is nice not to have to come up with what is reasonable on my own.

' Pet Peeve: I don't use the default location for the tax returns due to how I set up my backup software. The H&R Block software does not initially remember this new location on the second start of the application, it told me I have no returns. I needed to pick the return manually from the File menu, as it did remember recently used files. The third time I started the software, it finally knew the location of the tax return file.

' At the end of the interview process there is a check step (which you can run at any time, but the interview ends with this check). This step flags problems (e.g. missing information) and potential audit alerts (e.g. unusual deductions) with red flags, and reminders (e.g. things you marked tentative) with yellow flags.

' Sometimes I want to return to some section of my return. The best way to jump to any section directly without navigating through other pages is to use ""take me to"" button which is displayed at the top of every page, on the same line as H&R Block banner.

' Does H&R has the ability to import TurboTax data from previous years?
Yes. TurboTax files have a .tax extension. Use the Browse button within H&R Block application to navigate to the folder you need and it will import the data from TT return.

' The final tax return can be saved in a .PDF format for future reference.

'  In 2014 TurboTax's introduced a requirement that the data had to be sent to Intuit's servers to be formatted for printing. I verified that H&R Block can print forms when Ethernet connection is disconnected.

'  If you owe taxes there are three options for payment: electronic withdrawal from your bank, mailing a check and paying by credit card from a secure web site. Is there a charge to pay by credit card? Yes. There are three web sites that do this service and the fees vary from the lowest of $2.50 flat fee for a debit card to highest of 2.25% fee by credit card from one of the web sites.  If you search for ""pay taxes by credit or debit"" you will see the detailed fee schedule on the irs.gov web site.

' IDENTIFY THEFT AND TAX RETURNS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
' Last year there were many reports of thieves filing fraudulent tax returns using stolen social security numbers
If this happens the person who tries to file their own tax return gets the following error:

IRS records show the spouse's Social Security number (SSN) on this return is the same as the primary taxpayer's SSN on another return already filed this year. Double-check your spouse's SSN. Fix any issues and e-file again. Otherwise, you'll have to file a paper return.

What to do if this happens?
1. Call HRB told them of the issue (1-800-472-5625)
2. Call IRS (1-800-829-1040) had them flag the SS#
IRS states that people need to mail completed return, a copy of police report or Form 14039 Identity Theft Affidavit (...), copy of Drivers License or passport or SS card.
3. Call Equifax and have them put an alert on the SS# (They notify Experian and TransUnion as well)
4. Call Social Security Administration and notify them (1-800-772-1213)
5. File with FTC (...)
6. File a police report of a possible identity theft

I have been a H&R Block/TaxCut user for many years. I keep coming back because it works well for the tax forms I need to do and it is less expensive than TurboTax. If you have a question I have not covered leave a comment and I will do my best to answer it.

Personally, I do not need most of the bells and whistles offered by the Internet and Maximum Security versions. This is because I already have a utility program that provides PC performance tools, do not care about shredding my files, utilize a separate password program, do not want to spend the time to ""sync"" my computer with my phone or tablet, care about WiFi only at home, and am not a social networker.  However, if these activities are of concern, then Antivirus+ is too basic, and you should consider the other two versions.

It is imperative to uninstall any other antivirus program you are running before attempting to install Antivirus+.  I installed it on a computer running Windows 7 with Internet Explorer 9; the entire process took me less than 10 minutes.  All of the settings, as well as access, are very intuitive; there is an icon in the lower right-hand side that will control everything from a drop-down menu.  It is very easy to set the program to automatically update and run scans.  Note that when you set up an account with Trend Micro, of course you also have to enter a password, but as additional security, all of your program settings are separately password protected as well, so for simplicity's sake, you may wish to make the passwords the same.",I was really concerned about the security features available on this PC when I was first introduced to the Netherland desktop.

I anxiously installed it.  The first thing was that a newer version was available, so I tried to download and install it.  It failed, and an error message came up saying there is a ""known problem"" and ""strongly recommended"" a manual download/install.  It provided some very confusing instructions, but I'm fairly competent with computers, so I managed to manually download/install the new version.

The most disturbing feature was that during every restart of the computer, prior to Windows loading, a Acronis page appears, making you select to go to one of the Acronis applications or you MUST select Windows to go to a ""normal"" Windows startup. I went to ""MSConfig"" to the ""Startup"" and ""Services"" tabs and shut down anything regarding Acronis.  But I couldn't kill the Acronis startup page.  So, I explored the program, under tools but didn't find any help.  There was an ""Options"" button, but it didn't work (deactivated?).  I looked under ""help"", again without results.  I tried ""Customer Service"" links, but they were deactivated (I wonder why???).  I tried looking though the history of problems others were having, and was amazed that such a new program would have volumes of problems reported already.

So, I went to the control panel and uninstalled the program.  Unfortunately, afterward, the Windows backup and restore functions no longer worked.  I was able to complete a ""system restore"" and recovered the Windows backup and restore.

I use Windows backup and restore and Norton Ghost, but I'm not going to touch a Acronis product again!  Yuck!","I have been using this software for quite some time.

The interface will be instantly recognizable to anyone who has used AVG in the past couple of years.  It remains simple and clean with its intuitive three-tab design that is suitable for both experienced and new users.

COMPONENTS:
Here is a list of the three tabs, and a quick synopsis of what the components do.

Overview Tab:
  * Anti-Virus: Protection from and removal of viruses, trojans, and worms including infected .EXEs or .DLLs.
  * Anti-Spyware: Protection from and removal of spyware, malware, adware.
  * Anti-Spam: Protects against spam and phishing attempts, marking suspicious incoming email as [SPAM].
  * Firewall: Blocks or permits network traffic on a rule-by-rule, program-by-program basis. 'Gaming Mode' prevents firewall rule pop-ups from interrupting play.  Handy 'Emergency Mode' blocks all internet traffic in the event you feel you are being hacked.
  * LinkScanner: Surf-Shield and Search-Shield actively block dangerous websites and scan search engines for threats.
  * Anti-Rootkit: Searches out hidden rootkit dangers on your computer.  This scan can be scheduled separately, run with another scan, or manually started.
  * System Tools: Like Windows' Task Manager, it shows your running system processes, active network connections, etc but with security levels.
  * Email Scanner: Scans outgoing and incoming email for threats.
  * Identity Protection: Analyzes and scans your programs in an attempt to prevent the loss of personal information such as passwords and credit card info.
  * Web Shield: While using instant messaging programs, prevents you from downloading or exchanging infected files.
Resident Shield: Actively scans your files as they are opened, copied, or saved to prevent the activation of threats.
  * License: Your license info is displayed here.  This program is for a 2-year subscription for a single computer.
  * Update Manager: Set it and Forget it.  Automatically keeps the program up-to-date.

Computer Scanner Tab:
  * It's now easier than ever to setup and maintain scans that suit your time and liking.  Want to scan for viruses, adware, and spyware on Monday at 2:00pm, and then scan for Rootkits on Wednesday at 11am?  It's simple to set it all up here, however and whenever you want.

Update Tab:
  * Click this tab to begin a manual update of the program and its components.

IMPRESSIONS:
The Firewall has undergone major improvement.  It is less obtrusive than the previous version, automatically creating rules for trusted programs/access without bothering you with any annoying 'stop everything and attend to me' pop-ups.  The Computer Scanner interface tab now shines for its easy to use scheduling of single or multiple scans, manual scans of your computer, or manual scans of just selected files.  The Virus Vault and the History could still use some work, but they are perfectly functional as is.

CONCLUSION:
I've used AVG free and paid versions for many years, and I think this version of their internet suite is  the best yet.  It's easy to install, runs great on my Windows 7 64-bit, is full-featured without bloatware, has a clean and simple interface for beginners, yet still allows experienced users to tweak the nuts and bolts to their liking.","I had a hard time using this product when I first got this product, and I started using it right away.

year | improvement | email | program | couple | address | book | calendar | functionality | contact | manager | level | import | app | information | resource | downside | backup | mail | pain | way | keep | track | life | bit | lot,"A year or so ago, I switched to Outlook, and while I can't say that I really liked it, I did find that it was an improvement over my old email program in a couple of important ways.  It offered integrated address book, and calendar functions, and it didn't crash every fifteen minutes.  I got used to its drawbacks because it offered me greater functionality.

Along comes Outlook 2007 with the contact manager, and suddenly there's a whole new level of functionality to make me even happier.  Now I can sync my Outlook calendar with my Google calendar, import RSS feeds and, with a tiny app and a couple of keystrokes, I can import contact information quickly from any online resource.

On the downside, and predictably, it takes forever to install.  Backup of everything except archived mail is sort of a pain, and the way it creates files is kind of squirrely.  But in general I'd say that it's made keeping track of my life just a bit simpler.  And that's worth a lot to me.","I've been using this program for about 1 year.

I have used Cyberlink products for at least the last 5-10 years. I have always thought the software does what it says it will do and is easy in doing it. PowerDVD 13 continues the tradition.

Installation (on a Win7 64-bit HP ProBook) was a breeze: stick the CD in and follow instructions. Done.

Using the program was equally easy. First you enter the supplied product key. Once activated (internet connection required) the welcome screen offers an option to see some tutorials on the Cyberlink website (the package also includes a printed manual that is well-written, easy to understand, and helpful [but I'm not so sure you will even need the manual]). Once you get to the main screen it will tell you either to insert a BluRay (or DVD) or click on ""play.""

It's that easy. Really. Not kidding.

5 stars.

Unfortunately, I only have a portable web came to use with the Stopmotion Studio software. I hope soon to get something better, but even now it works for use to experiment with software.

The interface has a lot to it, but  you quickly learn your way around it. It sure didn't take long for my 10 year old to figure it out. I left him alone with Stopmotion Studio for 30 minutes. When I came back, I found him adding special effects to a still that I didn't even know we could do! Further looking, he took 119 shots and created a 12-15 second Godzilla theme that I thought was fantastic for his first time doing this. I was flabbergasted and absolutely proud of my son for his creativity and initiative.

I really like this software. It's relatively easy to use and has a lot of good features to get your creative juices flowing. I particularly like the onion skin to help me ghost a previously taken image onto my work area so I use it as a guide for my next pose.

Until Microsoft decides to natively decode blue ray through Windows Media Center (or whatever replaces it in Windows 8), you need a separate piece of software like this one.

For reference, I have an HTPC with a dual core 2.4ghz processor, 8gb of ram, and a blue-ray player connected to my plat panel TV.

PowerDVD is par for the course these days--sloppy, poorly coded garbage full of unnecessary bloat, with no option to install only the components you want or need. It reminds me of the way NERO went from a streamlined, easy to use program to a boat-fest resource hog. I also dislike how (as other reviewers noted) PowerDVD installs services that work in the background, sending your private data to corporations. Unless you manually stop them, they will track everything you watch and send that data off to marketing companies.

I didn't have any issues installing the software. Things went smoothly, and I was able to easily play a DVD. However, I elected NOT to keep this software on my computer, largely because a much easier solution exists for me. (I don't need it to play anything but Blue-Rays; I use XBMC for playing all my other media). An easy, frustration free way to play Blue Rays is with VLC (a free, excellent media player). Just use it to make .MKV files from each Blue Ray disk and then play them with VLC. For complete instructions, check the comments section of this review.

Basically, this is an overpriced, largely problematic software that you don't really need unless you just have to play Blue-Rays and don't want to mess around with VLC to rip them to .MKV files. I don't see a benefit to buying it unless you are willing to put up with frustration, turn off services sending away your private data, and don't have another option for a media suite.",I was using this program from scratch (I didn't realize that I need to buy more than one of the other programs) and found that the dvd itself wasn't bloatware.

I get their book every year called Deduct It or the Small Business taxes book which are really more or less duplicates of one another. When I saw that this Quicken Legal Business Pro 2014 included a copy of Deduct It I didn't hesitate to put in my order. Wow was I disappointed. Deduct it was a version that was several years old. The whole idea of getting the new book every year is that it is updated with all of the latest tax changes.
Then I went in to use some of the forms because we all know business is made up of agreements and there was another disappointment. Most of what I was interested in was only an explanation of it, and then an invitation to purchase what I needed. So it was a sales tool in order to buy more things. Suddenly the whole thing wasn't so beneficial after all. Of course I would be over-stating my claim if I said that there wasn't anything beneficial in there, but those two features alone when it is subtitled as contracts and forms was a bit of a disappointment to say the least.
I wound up buying the book Deduct It as a separate book which was the latest version. That is a NOLO book that is worthwhile. The money you save in taxes knowing what you are entitled to deduct does a job way better than any accountant can do. Like the book says, ""No one knows your company better than you do."" So knowing what is necessary and deductible before filing is crucial.

Until then, I had not been too familiar with the application, but was blown away with its performance. I soon replaced McAfee and Trend Micro on all my work PCs with Kaspersky and have been very happy ever since. Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2011 has continued this performance.

Why do I think it is the best anti-virus software? Well, I judge mostly on performance. I must be honest and say that I have never had a virus or worm, etc. on any of my computers; so, I cannot talk much to how well this or any other anti-virus catches incoming threats. Other than flagging the occasional virus in an email attachment, I have no experience with dealing with serious threats.

So performance... In the olden days, there was Norton; and, Norton was good - briefly. Then it became a resource hog and seemed to want to take over the computer and its processing power. Luckily, better and faster and less intrusive options like McAfee and Trend Micro came along; but, even these started to become a little burdensome after a while. Then, enter Kaspersky. Kaspersky runs quietly in the background, doesn't hog the processor, and doesn't try to take over my computer. The other aspect I rate under performance is updating... Kaspersky updates almost daily, and does it well in the background without taxing the computer. That was an issue that came along with Trend Micro - both its initial scan and updating upon booting up the computer, it held up Windows from fully loading until it was done... often up to five minutes!

So why only 2 stars you ask?
 My computer is set up so that all my pictures and videos are stored on external drives to keep as much free space on my C drive. When I tried to find a way to install this on the external drive, I could not! So I searched for a way to and couldn't find ANYTHING, so as it is still a relatively new release I called support  (and I hate calling support for anything, it is always so aggravating) well I learned that you can NOT install this on ANY drive other than your computer's C drive!
Wait...... it gets better!
You cannot install ANY version of Studio 19 on an external drive!
So are they going to do anything about it...................??
Sure, they are going to ""consider changing"" that aspect of it back to allow this (their older versions let you do it!) on their future versions......
Yeah, ""Future""....
So I still gave it two stars for all it has and the price point but IMO the fact that they took away that VERY important option totally kills it for me.
I would really need to upgrade my computer ($$$) a LOT to edit videos on its C drive,

As such, I have been a fan of Streets and Trips since the 2002 version. Unfortunately, Streets and Trips is merely a slight improvement over its predecessor, Streets and Trips 2006, and still has most of the key problems.

There is no question there are several benefits to Streets and Trips over online ""free"" applications with their invasive advertising, sluggishness and reliance on an Internet connection. Resident map data addresses all of these annoyances and gives the user more control. Putting that particular debate aside, Streets and Trips 2007 does suffer from a lack of connectivity in its inability to update core grid data and point-of-interest data over the Internet.

As I mentioned in my review of S&T 2006, Google Earth is setting the stage in the consumer map world. While Satellite photos do little for trip planning, Google does a nice job of locally caching large amounts of data from a remote server. The Streets and Trips development team must do the inverse of this. Most of the data should be resident on the local computer with dynamic integration from a variety of remote sources.

Dynamic updates can serve many purposes. The most straightforward is correcting inaccurate road information and updating core data as new roads are constructed. Secondly, there is a great deal of POI (point of interest) data that could be updated continuously. Lastly, if Microsoft promoted a comprehensive ecosystem, various government and private entities could provide plug-ins for Streets and Trips. At the current time, this ecosystem does not exist.

The lack of real-time connectivity leads to other shortcomings. In essence, Streets and Trips creates static maps. This precludes the implementation of real-time traffic or weather. Sadly, Microsoft has lost out on so many other value-added features that are provided by Google Earth, Yahoo Maps, and the Weather Channel online.

Oddly, key problems in its management of basic street data persist. For example, it can't properly interpret hyphenated street addresses in the boroughs of New York. Of course, it is impossible for a single user to error check the entire database, so I am curious what other errors exist.

Like most map programs, Streets and Trips is automobile-centric. This means that it interprets one-way streets literally. While great for drivers, it doesn't help for walking. Moreover, there is no interpretation of public transit systems where users would walk to a subway or train stop, board, and walk to a destination.

Shortcomings aside, Streets and Trips 2007 is still a very useful consumer mapping tool. After you become accustom to the application, you will find yourself using it for the most mundane trips. It is very fast and easy to use - perfect last-minute errand planning. In the larger context, however, Microsoft does need to update its Streets and Trips business model to provide users with the same features they have grown accustom to with web-based applications. Only then with Microsoft have a killer app.

Pros

Fast

Ease of use

Exceptional clarity in maps and interface

No advertisements

First connectivity steps with Windows Live

Cons

Can't properly interpret hyphenated addresses

No export of point-of-interest data

No integration with 3rd party data

No real-time traffic

But now that I'm older, I find myself really attached to it. I think what I disliked is that there is a lot (and I mean a lot) of running around and learning. Which also happened in Secret of the Scarlet Hand, though it was handled better there. So what makes me like it now? Well, it's the most straight forward game (aside from the later games that would literally hand you a letter or a diary that told you exactly how to play the game -- and for not having those, I appreciate this game all the more, since is shows you can have that sort of story and NOT tell the player of a MYSTERY game exactly what they need to do to reach the ending). And really, the learning isn't all that bad.

I appreciate the characters more now, and the ending. I love the ending. Also, after looking at several other games, I've come to love how everything works together. All of the puzzles help you in some way.

However, I wouldn't recommend this game to new-comers to the series, or to the impatient fans. It isn't the most exciting game, so if you're looking for a game to get into the series with I'd point you more towards Treasure in a Royal Tower or Secret of Shadow Ranch. If you want a learning heavy game as your intro, I'd say go for Scarlet Hand, just be prepared as it's ending is a little scary.","I was a kiddo fan, and I was delighted that I was able to play with them.

Don't join the masses. With Apple's new G5 systems, Macs blow everything else out of the water. Sure there are more Windows users than Mac users. There are also more cockroaches than humans. Does that make the cockroach a superior being? (Well, the immunity to radiation bit is in their favor.)
Jaguar is the latest release of OS X. A true multitasking operating system based on UNIX. Yes, there is a REAL version of UNIX under the hood and the hackers among you will drool over the possibilities. Apple is beginning to take advantage of the superior hardware design capabilities of the Mac with OS X.
The best part, OS X hides the UNIX underpinnings in a superior Graphical User Interface (known as Aqua.) So, if you know nothing about UNIX, don't worry, you don't have to know UNIX to use a Mac. Ease of use has been the hallmark of Macs since their introduction back in 1984.
You have the ability to create a true multi-user enviornment. Multiple userids, multiple processes running simultaneously and protected memory. This means if you have a program crash, only the one program will crash, everything else keeps going and going and going. (Sorry Energizer Bunny, I couldn't resist.)
If you are a UNIX lover, Apple provides the Terminal application which gives you full access to the UNIX kernel system.
If you are among the long-time Mac user community, you may have come to love the capabilities of OS 9 (or 8 or earlier.) Some Macs still have the ability to boot into either OS 9 or OS X. Newer Macs only allow OS X booting. If you still have programs from the days when you could boot into OS 9, you can still run many of them in ""Classic"" environment. Classic is an emulator, running on OS X to allow you to still run older programs requiring the older OS. Admittedly, there are programs that won't work in Classic. Mostly programs needing custom-made extensions or Control Panels may not load. Also, most of the still-existing software companies are creating native OS X versions of their programs.
If you insist on running Windows XP or 2000 or 98 or 95 or DOS, you even have the option of running Virtual PC (which, by the way, is now owned by Microsoft - think about that for a moment.)
There is also a Mac version of Microsoft's Office Suite. This allows you to exchange documents with your PC counterparts, seamlessly.
Macs have superior video capabilities and OS X takes full advantage of this.
OS X has some superior software to go along for the ride - iMovie, iDVD, iPhoto and iTunes, to name a few. These are all free.
With OS X, Mac users will be leaving others in the dust.
Superior hardware design coupled with well-thought-out software design makes the Mac environment hard to beat. Add to that the ability to use state-of-the art hardware and nothing else even comes close. Long live Mac!",I have a water cockroach immunity and I've never ever had a single cockroach in my lifetime. I was a bit hesitant about this one because I didn't think it would work for me.

However, McAfee All Access (2014) is readily available.

Not many manual controls. Otherwise, LiveSafe all-in-one suite smoothly protects household (network) devices with various most popular operating systems (OSes) eliminating the need to pay much more for the same for each separately. Not supported are: Windows Mobile and older ones, like Windows XP SP2, original (1st) Vista, Mac OS 10.5 Leopard, Google Android 2.1, BlackBerry 4.4, iOS 4 and below, which could be upgraded mostly for free, and Nokia Symbian. Also anti-phishing is not supported for older browsers such as Internet Explorer 6, Firefox 11, Safari 4, and below, but they also can be upgraded for free.

LiveSafe protects against viruses, spyware, phishing (stealing ID), spam, and includes a firewall, website safety rating, content filtering, and more for some; most for PCs including a parental control. Buying a single suite seems economical and conflict free. The installation is very easy and directly from the McAfee website. No CD/DVD drive is needed, but a decent Internet connection. All functions are more or less self-explanatory and typical. Goggling an unclear question provides an answer. An upgrade covering a household of up to 5 is available.

It detects, removes old at the installation, and blocks well new viruses from accessing through email, downloading, or copying, has a small initial footprint, and uninstalls completely unlike one of the competitors, which leaves a residue interfering with superseding security programs, and which requires a special uninstalling program from the Internet. LiveSafe is constantly up-to-date. It works fast and in the background, and allows manual customization in case of an atypical computer setup. A description of virtually every case can be found on the Internet. However, it displays warnings in an intrusive way and some of them considered excessive or unnecessary cannot be customized or prevented.

Initially, LiveSafe takes up less than 100 MB of memory (RAM) that is much less than the competitors. However, not all memory (RAM) used to monitor the running programs is freed after closing them. Subsequently, it tends to increase memory retention during or after using especially Web browsers. That so called memory leakage drains away memory causing the computer to slow down to a crawl and theoretically even to a halt (crash). However, it is unnoticeable in and thus irrelevant to modern, multi-core computers with min. 4 GB of RAM (memory).

LiveSafe automatically updates its new virus data base via the Internet by the included 1-year subscription. Its operations are transparent in the background. It is as fast and thorough as other leading security programs. The installation is simple and fast. Everybody could do it. It is as good as it gets.","I was using this incarnation for several years and found useful incarnation keys,that was before I gave me the password, and then I used them sparingly so as not to use any malicious software.

While is does a pretty good job, I quickly realized that I would need a slightly more comprehensive editing package to get them where I ultimately wanted them and to remove imperfections and blemishes.  It seems that PSP can make changes to a Sony RAW file, but it cannot save it back to ARW or even to RAW format (it saved an 'empty' file).  You have to export it to JPG right then.  Given this limitation, I will still be using Sony's RAW converter and use this for further editing.  Furthermore, I think most photographers would recommend that you use the manufacturers RAW converter for best results.

The software is laid out well and I can quickly go from browsing photos to editing and back again.  There are also many filters and effects that are easily applied with the click of a button.  NIK Color Efex Pro 3.0 is really great with alot of filters that are adjustable.  The filters in PSP are not adjustable, so the ability to tweak them in Efex is really nice.  I have not found alot of use for FaceFilter Studio 2 as you can do much of the color and skin tone adjustments in PSP.  This is supposed to allow you to tweak facial expressions, but it does not let you zoom into faces in order to place the markers.  It basically needs to be a close up of someones face only to get them placed properly.  Seems pointless.  At any rate, the rest of the features are worth it to me.

Incidentally, you have the option of modifying your lessons so that you can choose to learn speaking only, speaking and listening, speaking, reading and listening, etc., although they recommend selecting it all.  I was tempted to select speaking only, but decided if I was going to do this, I may as well do it thoroughly.  Finding the time is going to be the biggest challenge, but I have been heartened by the relatively short - 30 minutes - time for each lesson I've encountered so far in Level 1.

I find the immersion concept of teaching to be an interesting one and am hopeful their methods will be effective.  I especially like the use of images as I think that serves as visual reinforcement and greatly assists in remembering.  I'll update my review as I make progress with the program and see how well I'm absorbing and retaining what I'm taught.  So far, I've been impressed with everything I've encountered.

There were computers at our school, but for some reason, only the people in the business track could use them, the college track kids had to use the typewriters. When I finally did get to use wordprocessing, Word came free with microsoft stuff, but it sort of reminded me of what is now ""notepad"" or google docs, and for REAL documents, you bought a good program. I got Wordperfect. I loved it. So easy to learn, so adaptable to anything I wanted. To me, an analogy would be when you want to draw a picture...Wordperfect is like having a paper and a pencil, you can do anything you want. Word is like having a set of rubber stamps, you can make a picture sure, but it is only easy if you do standard stuff.

As time went on, people stuck with Word (because it was free) and the program got better. places I have worked have used Word as their default program...and I could never love it. I went through a period where I figured I wouldn't update an old Wordperfect (it was on 3.5 floppy discs!) and force myself to go with the masses. Arggg...I hated it. Why was it sticking in stuff I didn't want!? Why was it so difficult just to type an underline on a bare space? Why was it trying to guess what I was doing and not letting ME do it!? I didn't want to take 5 extra steps just to STOP something from happening...let alone the frustration of trying to switch up fonts/spacing/lists, mid-document. Word doesn't like that. It likes what it knows, and you have to work to get around what it wants. I never let it win...fight the man! ha ha! What a pain, though.

I soon abandoned those efforts to jump ship and went back to Wordperfect and never looked back. Before you could save as different formats well (the formatting always got messed up...either way you went...from Word to WP or from WP to Word) I would recreate work forms (like where there is a master and you fill in data by hand...like a mileage sheet or something) on Wordperfect. People would constantly come up to me and ask for a copy of my master documents because they looked so good. But they didn't have Wordperfect and couldn't open them right. I am never the ""boss's favorite"", but at least I get SOME pats on the back for something...my documents.

Now, Google docs is the thing...likely because it is free (wonder where they came up with that business model? Betcha it won't be after we all switch!) I cannot now open wordperfect documents into google docs. You can store them there, like you can with drive, but it won't convert. You can save as rtf, but sometimes I have a lot of charts or graphics and they get messed up. I still have to figure that out. I still use Wordperfect. I use drive for my own stuff, or just a flash drive.

I still get asked how I get such nice graphs and my things in my documents, and they all come from Wordperfect. Even if I have to cut and paste them into some other crappy program.  This newest version even has .pdf editing...no extra cost. I know people say that ""only lawyers use wordperfect!"" (I am a teacher), but to me, lawyers whole world revolves around documents, so they would know better than anyone which is the best program for them.

If you are a Wordperfect user, I don't have to convince you why it is so superior. If you are not a user, you may not understand, until you see just one thing...the glorious ""reveal codes."" You can see every space, every letter, every moment you switch fonts, or the exact space where underlining starts and ends. And you can put things exactly where you want them...want an extra space after that period? done. Want to extend your underline 15 spaces (like for a date or initials or something?) done. Italicize 2 letters in the middle of a word? simple. Change the spacing of just a few lines in a paragraph? no problem. You don't have to be a perfectionist or OCD to use this...but if you are...or just like things the way you like them...this is your program!

I will never stop using Wordperfect. I taught my children this program and they ask for it now on their computers. I am hoping with the rise of (currently free) google docs, the world will move away from the often-wretchedness of Word, and re-discover the difference between a ""usable"" program and a wonderful one. Then again, it is kinda nice being the only one with awesome documents and getting all the praise! ha ha!!",I have been using Typewriters since I was eight and started using them when I was 16 and started using Wordpress 5.5. After using this program I decided to purchase the full size of the word processor. It is easy to use.

( There are options to turn off blinking cursor and ""unnecessary animations"" if you search for them, while having seizures of course while you do so )

I wanted to purchase a newer notebook than the one I am currently using to write this review so I purchased a brand new HP Pavilion ( HP Pavilion dv9500t ). See order below. I wanted better screen resolution as I have fairly serious eye problems and I wanted better performance than this Compaq R4010T that I had to go back to to write this review on..

I have really bad epilepsy ( and it is getting worse and worse because I keep getting clobbered by this bad technology ) and I am having seizure after seizure using THE NEW COMPUTER WITH WINDOWS VISTA ON IT because of Microsoft Vista's inaccessibility.

The problem is that Microsoft has gone from the innocuous ""hourglass"" icon to the Apple ""spinning wheel"" style icon whenever you click on almost ANYTHING. I have turned off every option, feature, flag that I can trying to stop this and I can't.

I absolutely can't use this computer and I can't use Vista. What sort of idiots are these people? Haven't they ever heard of epilepsy? I abandoned Apple Macs because of my epilepsy and now Microsoft has to try to out apple Apple with this lemon.

My brain really can't afford to have any more seizures. I have repeatedly told my doctor that I have to go to ZERO blinking / flashing / animations with NO exceptions. Good luck with all this terrible technology. Unfortunately, nothing will kill me so I have to suffer and suffer and suffer. I have to use a computer as that is the ONLY way I can get anything done such as shopping.

The problem is that I can see that the clock is ticking and it is just a matter of time before I, and people like me, are totally disenfranchised from the moder world. ( Recently I had to go back to a rotary telephone because I no longer tolerated my higher tech LCD phone )

Anyways, this review won't last long because we all have to have a rosy view of how great everything is and we don't want to be disturbed by roadkills like me on the information superhighway.

$1823.27 down the drain.

It's pretty standard software. Load onto the computer and follow the steps to download it.

You can only use it for one person, so don't think about sharing it unless you want to purchase one that allows you to share with others.

As for this software... It even has a video to help you get started and to import contacts. Once you register, then you go right into the setting up your will.  In addition to a will, you get to create a durable power of attorney document, a health care directive and other documents that you may need. You can even create a final arrangements checklist for your survivors.

WillMaker also gives you other forms that are not really part of your will, but useful for folks. This includes such things as authorizations for minors, a housesitting agreement, request for a birth certificate. There is really a lot of forms that you may use in your lifetime, but probably several you never will. But WillMaker tries to cover all the bases.

It's convenient and easy to use if you're looking for a low cost alternative to hiring an attoreny.","I have used this product in the past and have never had a problem with software that is so complex and requires a lot of resources.

I've used both these competitors, and of the two, in terms of stability and ease of use Video Studio has it over Adobe. So how does Movie Edit Pro, from Magix measure up? I've used Magix music software with good results, so I was curious to see if Movie Pro would be an easy video editor for the home film maker.

The good news: this is an easy-to-use software. The less than good news is that the installation requires that you do a lot of downloading after the initial installation, so it's a bit lengthy to get going. However, it's not a bad package and if you like their Music Pro, you may well enjoy this.

 For one thing, the 2016 version is definitely designed to please the GoPro user.  In particular, they include Mercalli Image Stabilization (a third-party plug-in specifically for reducing the inevitable hand jiggle that comes with vidcams, especially GoPro.  The Pro version comes with V2. If you want V4 (and also some extensive effects filters, the Premium edition has NewBlue Action Cam included.)  Plus and Premium also have 360 degree editing, Pro does not. If for some reason, you import a 360 degree file, it will be a normal video file in Pro.

Note: Video Editing is a resource-heavy task. You need to have a computer that has enough power, especially with the CPU and the graphics card. This is not a task for a small laptop aimed at web surfing and email.

Requirements:
Processor  Quad-core processor with 2.8 GHz or better recommended (minimum is 2GB)
RAM Minimum  2 GB Recommended but 8GB recommended
8 GB Graphics card Minimum: Onboard, minimum resolution 1280 x 768
512 MB VRAM
Hard drive space Minimum: 2 GB for program installation
Internet Connection for installation.

The help menu is very good. As you create a film, if you are not familiar with a feature, you can go to the Magix website for tutorials or a user forum. This isn't unique to Magix, but it is good that it is there. I find the EASIEST way to learn any software is to take on a task, and then learn as I go, picking up a tutorial or working through help online.  Then, I pick another task and slowly, I become familiar with the software's features.

When you start up the software,  a dialogue box appears  with various choices for what you wish to do.

Your choices are to start a new project, with new settings, to open a project that you are already working on, or use a ""Easy Mode"" quick template with preset items for a guided editing session.

 As you become familiar with the software, you can skip past this and go directly to your choice of task.

 Some great features--you can have up  to 32 tracks of media in one project (99 in Premium),  You can also import from wireless devices and export to your phone, to Facebook, to an SD card. You can burn DVDs or Blu-Ray.

You can download a 30 day trial--and I'd recommend that. In particular, the Plus and Premium versions have so many more features, including FISHEYE CORRECTION, that you may find that it's worth it to buy the more advanced version. Right now the limited ""Plus"" edition is available for a short time for the same price as the basic Pro edition, with some of the Premium features so it's worth it to compare.

Summary: This isn't a bad video editing package, but I would recommend downloading the PLUS limited edition at the sale price rather than the base version I am reviewing.","I'm a big DIY fan.

Installation was easy, although the first thing KIS 2011 did was check for a more recent version of itself, which I downloaded before I installed anything.  Nice to be up to date.  Upon completing installation, I manually updated the virus definitions.  I'm sure the program would have done it automatically given time, but I wanted to update them right away, so I did it manually.

The program has a very clean and organized interface.  Finding what you need is fast and easy.  A big green button lets you know you are safe and protected.  Alternatively, if something is amiss this button will be yellow or red so you can easily tell the state of your protection.

I was also impressed with how configurable KIS 2011 is.  If you like to tweak settings, then you'll love it.  That being said, it also runs extremely competently ""out of the box"" with everything left at ""default.""  It does not seem to slow my computer at all, which is a huge plus.

Parental controls are extensive and easy to use, and include monitoring of time, blocking webpages and keywords, and allowing internet usage.  Accounts can be password protected, so your kids can't change the settings!  Extra features of KIS 2011 include a virtual keyboard (keyloggers can't detect this type of input) which installs into your browser, and is activated on demand by a tiny icon in the browser's existing toolbar.  I thought this was a nice way to implement this feature; no annoying extra toolbars cramping your browser window!

This version has a license for three computers, but be aware that you have to install and activate all three licenses within 30 days of the first one, otherwise the remaining/unactivated ones will be invalid.

In conclusion: I have tried two other 2011 ""Internet Security"" suites, and uninstalled both.  KIS 2011 is my choice for this year.  I'm very happy with it.","I have a laptop which has the latest version of Windows 7 installed. The only thing I woud suggest is that they don't have any virus.

Maybe the 64 bit operating system is necessary to utilize the new Intel processors. Other than that, my experience is that this product has NOTHING to recommend it and I would hardly call it an ""upgrade.""

(1) Older software for which I paid hundreds of dollars now works poorly if at all. As an example, Corel PhotoPaint (which I use for illustrations in technical articles) often crashes with something about a SmartHeap error. AAA Map and Go does not work at all. And I have used Compatibility Mode in an attempt to make them work properly. This in fact did correct a problem with my TomTom software, which is hardly a relic from the 8 bit or 16 bit operating system days.

(2) A laser printer for which I paid a couple of hundred dollars is now a paperweight because there is no 64 bit driver for it. The manufacturer's technical support department claims it did try to develop one but was not successful.

(3) Navigation of files with Windows Explorer is somewhat more difficult with the Windows 7 version than the XP version.

The biggest problem is however security. I have spent (wasted) hours fighting with Windows 7 over permission to modify or delete files and/or registry keys. Even though I am the computer's sole owner and user, many files have four or five ""users"" (e.g. System, Administrator) with different permission levels. I am now trying to install an update to my virus protection software but keep getting slammed with Error 1402, which shuts down the installation. Windows 7 blocked me from trying to apply the comprehensive solution to Error 1402 that I found online. Disabling User Account Control did not work either. My computer is therefore now without virus protection, so Windows 7 is quite frankly now a security exposure for me, although the virus software's manufacturer does offer support and can probably help me on Monday.

I am an experienced user and, despite hours spent searching Microsoft and other sites for a solution to the 1402 error, have not been able to find one. I can only imagine the frustration a regular home user or even small business person might have with this, or how much time even a large corporation's IT department could waste on fixing these issues.

Update August 21 2012

Features (e.g. Windows Update) simply do not work, and neither do the programs Microsoft supplies to correct the problems.

When I run Windows Update, it shows that 16 updates, including those related to security and function, are ready to install. I tell it to go ahead and do so, and it simply tells me the updates were not installed with a worthless error message: ""Windows Update Encountered an Unknown Error""

I ran MicrosoftFixit.wu. LB.25268956865207935.1.1. Run.exe and it returned the message, ""Repair Windows Update Components: Not Fixed"" (another highly useful and informative Microsoft error message). Microsoft FixIt ""Explore Additional Solutions"" is an equally worthless Web page with no specific information whatsoever--only useless generalities.

These are just a couple of examples. This product is poorly designed, unreliable, and quite frankly worse than useless.

ABSOLUTELY!  Do you need an antispyware (ASW) program if you web surf?  You probably should.  Do you need Trend Micro's AV and ASW 2010?  Uhm, no.

TM's AV is BASIC.  If you have to pay for this, you can get the same basic AV capabilities using free online software (do a google search on free antivirus).  You'll note that when you look at the back of the box--not shown on Amazon, you can see that our of all the nifty gadgets and gizmos that TM AV premium has, and wonder why the heck you bought the basic version--there's not much there.

Sure, TM's AV/ASW 2010 quotes itself for being optimized for WINXP, WINVISTA, and WIN7, but to tell the truth, so do all the other AV's out there.  And guess what?  There's no proof in the pudding.  It's no faster or slower than anything else out there, but there's not much to the program, so yeah, it's probably much quicker than its premium cousins.  Big surprise.

TM's AV/ASW 2010 has a feature that is kind of odd is its behavioral engine--I have no idea what it does, and you'll never find out in the manual either.  Also, it does the basic quick scans, full scans, and scheduled scans, but the timing for the scheduler leaves A LOT to be desired.

Bottom line: should you purchase this?  If you don't do the research on any other AV program, and you really want to have basic AV protection, then yes.  However, I'd say just get a little web search savvy and pick up some freeware OR go to the well-established AV products from the ""other"" companies.","I have been using Antivirus software since it launched, back several months ago.

There are also some security improvements that are useful: e.g., Word opens downloaded files in a protected mode; PowerPoint allows presentations to be restricted from editing/copying.

If you're trying to decide between this version and a previous one, definitely I'd recommend this one.  If you're trying to decide whether to pay for an upgrade, it depends on how irritated you get with the limitations of the ribbon in the 2007 version.

  First I ran the compatibility checker of course and it said all hardware was compatible and only had a couple of software problems like it said I had to uninstall security essentials and wireshark not compatible. Not bad I thought. First impressions are important and the Windows 8 upgrade setup program didn't give a good first impression. It's more confusing that the older Win7 installer for experienced user. I couldn't tell if I could install on separate partition since the only options were erase everything or upgrade everything. Later I figured out you can get the more familiar win 7 installer where it lets you choose what partition to install on and let's you erase, create new partitions but only if you rerun the win8 setup program from the dvd and reboot! Anyways, I did a dual boot install just to play it safe and keep Win7 around if needed. After finishing the install ,which didn't really seem much faster than Win7, and actually I thought it locked up at one point but it was hard to tell with the new plain square logo which doesn't even pulsate anymore like Win7 did when you booted.

  After the upgrade completed, I found out that my wireless didn't work. That's right even though it said my wireless was compatible it didn't work and I just got yellow exclamation next to it. I was about to give up but I figured I just try the trick I did when Vista first came out which is use another wireless usb stick to connect to the Internet and see if windows could find any drivers for it and sure enough that worked,so much for an improvement over Win7 in that regard.

  The first time you log into Windows 8 it plays a video showing you how to use Windows by moving your mouse to the edges. I thought this is pretty bad that they have to show a video just so people can figure out how to use the new OS GUI! If you don't want to waste time fumbling around trying to figure out where everything went and disappeared to learning the Win+X shortcut is essential! Actually, this is the first Windows version where I've actually used the keyboard more than my mouse since some things now take too many steps i.e. like shutting down or are near impossible to do. I got stuck a couple of times in some of the new metro apps took over my entire screen and I wasn't able to quit or get back to the desktop! Tip: if this happens to you just hit the Windows key on your keyboard. If you really can't stand the new GUI you can recreate everything just like in Win7 for the most part and stay in the classic desktop instead of the new metro start screen. Only thing that still annoys me and don't know if there is way to fix it is how slow the start icon and everything else takes to come up when you move your mouse to a corner of the screen. I know it's only a fraction of a second but it's still noticeable and that's why I just use the Windows key now to switch between things! Also, the hotspots in the corners tend to get in the way more often than not.

  All the programs and games I normally use in Windows 7 seem to work just fine in Windows 8. If it doesn't you can try right clicking to troubleshoot compatibility. My WEI score is the same in Win8 as it was in Win7 so seems no performance change according to that benchmark. Seems to be way more stable than Vista or even Win7 when it first came out. Haven't had a crash or even a pause in the GUI like I used to get with those when they first came out so that's a good sign.

 Another thing I didn't like is that there was like a 200MB update as soon as I first logged in and unlike Win7, Win8 rudely rebooted my computer in the middle of a browsing session and didn't warn me or give me option to postpone the reboot. At least on Mac OS X there is option to restore all your windows and browser to the way you had them, even after a reboot. Some of the things I do like about it so far is that you can now read pdf files without having to install acrobat just like mac os has always been able to, and IE now comes with Flash already built in. It's always annoying having to install all those basic programs.

  I really like the new task manager, it gives you a lot more info than before and Microsoft now has something that even mac os does which is very cool and needed by people nowadays with bandwidth caps, metered connections. If your right click your wireless it'll tell you how much bandwidth you have used. Now that I think about it a lot of the new stuff in Win8 seems like it's copied directly from OS X. For example, there are no games included now and Microsoft basically forces you to get minesweeper and solitare from the app store now! The icons on the metro screen are just like a cross between the widgets in OS X dashboard and launchpad. It's looks like they also copied the Xbox GUI and brought it into windows.

  Smartscreen, which caught me off guard first time I tried installing something, is Microsoft's version of Gatekeeper which does the same thing on OS X. So that is one of the new security features they added to Win8. Secure boot is another but I haven't messed with that.

  Biggest disappointments, from a technical point of view, is that Win8 isn't 64bit only like we thought it would be a couple of years ago. Even Mac OS X is now fully 64-bit although that upset the people that couldn't upgrade their older Macs. Also, the Achilles heel of Windows, the registry, because it's too easy to corrupt and render Windows useless, is still there along with the winsxs problem. The WinSxs problem can grow out of hand and eat up all your disk space! I've been saying since XP ,why can't they include .net into windows instead of making you download it like Java? A couple of programs I tried to run said I needed the .net 2 or 3 mainly Steam games and so I had to download another 20-200MB file for that to work and you have to be connected to net to download it since there is no standalone version.

  Another big letdown is that only the server version got the new filesystem ReFS, win8 only got storage spaces, which is more software raid. Microsoft has been promising a new improved filesystem several Windows versions back. I think the hardcore power users are going to have to accept the fact that the future of both Windows and Mac OS X is going to become and more geared to the iPod and Xbox crowd with their simplistic touch GUI and interface. This is also the group I'm guessing will have a more favorable view of the new GUI changes. I guess I'd probably be way more impressed if I had a touch capable PC since a lot of the new stuff seems to be geared towards that? I mean the command line is still there somewhere but it's hidden pretty good just like in OS X. Only thing I've really seen for geeks is something that macs and linux have been able to do for a long time already which is run the operating system from an external or usb stick, called windows to go but you need enterprise version for that.

  As far as improvements in performance go, I haven't really seen any performance increases or disc space savings to warrant being in a rush to upgrade. My boot times are pretty much the same as with Win7 but then again I have an SSD drive , so Windows has already been pretty fast using that. In fact, the upgrade installer said I needed to free up at least 20GB of space min to even start the upgrade! Still no less than Win7 and XP only needs 10GB. Personally, I think I'll stick with Win8 it since I need to do a clean install on my SSD anyways since I have a whole bunch of old Windows 7 updates hogging up my SSD (the WinSXS problem I mentioned above) and haven't really had any major show stoppers so far like Vista or even Win7 when it first came out.

  Finally, make sure you get the free media center upgrade while you can, otherwise you can't even play dvd's without installing powerdvd or some other program! I would've probably bumped my review up a start if it wasn't for Microsoft arbitrarily removing the start button so users are forced to use the new metro start screen whether you want to or not!

Update:Actually, they did finally add a new option to disk cleanup that few will notice that addresses the WinSXS issue:
This is a MAJOR improvement over Windows 7, but I bet they only did it for Windows 8 because of all the ranting about WinSxS.
This is a fantastic news for SSD users!

  You can find Disk Cleanup by typing:  WIN Key and start typing Disk Cleanup
  Click the Disk Cleanup's ""Clean up System Files"" Button in the middle of the screen.
  Check the box for Previous Windows Installation(s)
  Click ""OK"" button and click the ""Delete"" Confirmation button.
Now, only if they included a registry cleaner I'd give it 5 stars!","I was using this for about 4 years and found helpful restoring the compatibility checker. After 2 years use, I decided to replace it with the latest Win32 Prototype I had purchased. Then I used the Win32 Pro"

I primarily use a Mac and really do not like iWork (even now that it is free; I hate 'exporting' as DOC).  So I always use MS Office.  I have been using Office 2011 forever and felt really dated on my machine.  Especially when I do use Windows and use Office 2013.  I was excited to get Office 2016.

Installation was simple, I was not sure if I needed to, but to ensure a good install I followed the Microsoft KB article on removing all traces of Office 2011 before installing Office 2016.  Since the world thinks we all have time to wait for a download I downloaded Office 2016 which took about 20 minutes (it was about 1.2GB).  I thought it was not terrible but it took forever to install (1.5 hours) and it said it would only take 6.6GB so I am not sure why it took so long to install (I have a SSD Hybrid so it is not a write speed problem).  But anyway, I left it running overnight and when I woke up it was installed.

I just dragged Outlook to the trash since it is not included with this copy and no reason to waste space for something that just prompts to upgrade.  I would love it if one day Access, Publisher and Visio would be available for Mac.  But for now the only options you have is Word, Excel and PowerPoint.

The new versions are not a great UI change over the Office 2011.  I was kind of expecting a more Windows Office 2013 feel, but it is not a giant difference.  But it does seem a bit nicer than Office 2011.  The menus are all Mac like and dialogs are Mac like, so it feels more at home, but the Office 2013 version has some nice full screen screens when saving and printing which is nice; but it is not Mac like, so I guess I see why they were not brought over.

Word and Excel work as expected and I don't find much difference between 2011 and 2016.  I am experiencing some lag sometimes in Excel.  I think it is due to the animated box around the cells.  It is not a giant lag, but sometimes it is noticeable and locks the UI (beach ball).  I have a 2011 i7 MacBook Pro.

PowerPoint is nice and has some new transitions which are nice and remind me of the Keynote transitions; so I do like the new transitions, but they are not as good as the Office 2013 version; I guess Microsoft loves Windows more :)

In total I really like Office 2016, it has a nice look and feels  a bit more modern after upgrading from Office 2011. It is not as great as Office 2013, but it is better than Office 2011...  I still think there is no choice in Mac other than having Office, iWorks will never be a replacement and I cannot be expected to email .pages files to anyone and expect other than confusion...  So Office is a must for me!  I am happy with this update and highly recommend the box full version over the 365 for Office especially for Mac (since you lose a lot of the software).  And Office for iOS is free now so there is no great benefit over 365 if you are an Apple person.","I was really disappointed that AstraZene discontinued its products after 2 months due to lack of update.

New purchasers should not download version 4, but should go straight to iBank 5.

iBank won me over from Quicken for Mac, which steadily lost its market lead in personal finance software for the Mac platform after 2007 due to Intuit's failure to provide features on Mac comparable with its Windows-based product range.

iBank is highly capable software from a small company, IGG Software, which has demonstrated serious intent to develop and maintain a first-class niche product line for the Mac platform.

I was able to import 14 years of data from Quicken for Mac into iBank version 4 as a QIF file, and have every account and category - including share transactions and dividends - balance across the entire 14 years.  So I gave up waiting for Intuit to bring out a real update to Quicken for Mac 2007 and migrated to iBank in September 2012 - after testing and familiarization over a span of 18 months. I have not regretted the move, except that I should have done it earlier.

iBank had a new version 4.7 release in early February 2013; with a 4.7.1 update in early March; 4.7.2 in mid April; 4.7.3 at the end of July; 4.7.4 in mid October; and 4.7.5 in early November - all free online downloads to existing users. The new version 5, with an upgrade price of $29.99 to existing iBank users, was released in late November 2013. iBank 5 has some evolutionary improvements, such as categorization of investment income and some de-cluttering of the user interface, and has been an easy transition so far.

In itself the version number evolution says a lot about the high level of product support and development by its makers, IGG Software. The application has had numerous free online updates with significant new features. I bought and began experimenting with it at version 3. After my initial purchase (US$59.99) I have had to pay only for the two full version upgrades - a mere US$29.99 for the upgrades to version 4, and version 5. Any price under $100 for well-supported software of this quality and range of features is exceptional value for money.

As at November 2013, I have been using iBank almost daily for more than a year - currently in Mac OS X version 10.9 (Mavericks) - and have found it very stable with no obvious bugs. Earlier I found it just as stable in 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion), OSX 10.7.5 (Lion) and OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) -- Snow Leopard being the last operating system supporting the PowerPC application translator Rosetta, which was required for Quicken for Mac 2007.

Some features I especially like about iBank:

* Support for file exchange with other financial software, including ability to import QIF, OFX, QFX and CSV files; and to export its data in QIF or TXF format. Since version 4.7, released in February 2013, iBank has included further support for data import from Quicken Essentials for Mac, an unspeakable product from which Intuit inexplicably dropped QIF. The export format options provide a degree of confidence and safety in case it is necessary to migrate to other applications in future, or to exchange data with financial advisers using other apps. The QIF import is so reliable that I was able to import a file containing 14 years of detailed financial data from Quicken for Mac 2007 and every account balanced accurately. Minor problems I noticed in importing the QIF, and which could be corrected only manually, were:
1. Text in Quicken's distribution memo field did not come across for transactions where there was only one distribution (any text in Quicken's top memo field, the one visible without a ""twistie"", does transfer);
2. some currency symbols I had entered in Quicken payee and memo fields, like  and the Euro symbol, came across as the angled apostrophe, '; and
3. accented characters in payee and memo fields, e.g. ; and ;, dropped out entirely.

* Multiple currencies. This is really neat. Cash or bank accounts are easily set up in foreign currencies, with online downloadable exchange rates which all update with a single mouse click on a menu command or button. Also, accounts like credit cards that you might use for foreign currency transactions while travelling, or online shopping, easily can record both the home currency and foreign currency amounts - automatically calculating the effective exchange rate of each transaction based on the difference. Worked a treat for recording cash and credit card transactions in eight different currencies during my recent travels through Europe, South America and China.

* Reconciliation of bank and credit card accounts with statements is fast and easy. Super fast if the start and finish amounts in statements match those on corresponding dates in recorded account data: one click on the dropdown menu option ""Automatically reconcile : All transactions"", and you're done (regardless of whether the statement is one or 50 pages long). The manual reconciliation process is well-designed, with a large, easy-to-click reconciliation button on each transaction, and corrections possible while reconciliation is in progress. iBank archives ""virtual statements"" mirroring every reconciled statement. These can be reviewed as necessary at any time.

* Drag-and-drop works easily and intuitively for some uses, including changing the order of transactions on the same date. (A transaction cannot be dragged and dropped to a different funding account, but can be easily cut and pasted from one funding account to another).

* Payee and memo fields hold much more text than Quicken for Mac 2007 - so much more I can't even determine the limit. This makes it easy to enter full payee names and addresses, and detailed transaction descriptions. Foreign language characters - even Chinese (impossible in Quicken for Mac 2007) - can be entered in payee and memo fields, because iBank is fully compatible with the excellent built-in foreign language support of the Mac operating system.

* Invoices, receipts, correspondence, digital photos or other documentation can be attached in PDF or other formats to individual transactions. Only one file per transaction is attachable, but multiple documents (e.g. invoice, receipt and an image) can be attached if these are merged into one multi-page document such as a Word document or Acrobat PDF. (Version 4.6.1 appears to have fixed a glitch that prevented the document link opening in the Finder when clicked in iBank.) A very nice aspect of this feature is that iBank actually embeds the attached document in its current file; it does not merely use a link or path which could be broken due to disk reorganization or backup to other volumes. I like this feature so much that I've used it to retrospectively add PDF scans of receipts for major purchases going back years, where document retrieval might be necessary for warranties.

* The ""find"" feature indicated by a magnifying glass icon in the top right of the account view window is simple, fast and intuitive for searching and finding transaction payees, memos, or amounts. This ""find"" feature works either within single or grouped accounts, but not within reports.

* The built-in calculator, with simulated paper tape, under the ""Manage"" menu - from which results can be more conveniently copied and pasted as iBank transaction figures than from a desktop utility calculator.

* Simple mathematical calculations and formulas can also be entered in deposit and withdrawal amounts fields. As the manual states: 'For example, if you type ""5+3"" in the deposit field, iBank will automatically record a value of ""8.00"". Multiplication (*) and division (/) are performed before addition (+) and subtraction (-). Amounts are rounded to two decimal places. To specify the order of operations, you may group together parts of the calculation using square brackets [ ]. For example, if you enter ""[1/2]*[4-3]"" in the withdrawal field, iBank will calculate an amount of ""(0.50)"".' Type the figures for calculation or formulas, hit the ""Enter"" key, and the result enters.

* Reports including tax reports, investment portfolio statements, and net worth statements (balance sheets) can be generated on a range of standard templates, or with customized dates and content. The standard ""Portfolio Summary"" report, for example, is a time-saver and handy for tracking share investments, downloading latest available online quotes in one click for an entire portfolio when the correct stock exchange code and stock symbol have been recorded in iBank ""Manage:Securities"".

* Clicking on any single-line category total in a report - for example, ""credit card"", ""utilities"", ""misc expenses"" - will open a detailed full list of transactions for that category.

* Scheduled transactions include an option to automatically create an event and reminder in iCal. If the transaction is later edited, for instance, with a different amount, this updates the iCal event too. Neat.

One of the few important features lacking is global ""find and replace"". For example, this would speed up correction of the minor import errors in memo fields I mentioned above - or correction of inconsistencies that commonly develop in input of payee details. Multiple criteria search would be a useful future enhancement of the current simple search feature, too.

iBank also could be improved with a larger set - or, better yet, sets grouped by functional association - of report templates consistent with standard accounting practice and various tax reporting requirements, including more user customisation of content and format (fonts, column widths etc.). Graphs cannot be excluded in version 4+ from some standard reports such as income and expense reports and net worth statements. However, graphs don't appear in category reports (which might also be thought of as transaction reports), the content of which is flexible and text-only. Users with specific reporting needs, formatting requirements, or a need to create custom graphs, may have to copy and paste or drag and drop data into Microsoft Excel. That's not too difficult: it's just another step that would be useful as a built-in time-saving feature in future upgrades.

iBank has its own look and feel: it is not merely a knock-off or update version of Quicken or any other finance application, as far as I can see. Anyone coming to it from another application, or for the first time, needs to invest some time to familiarize themselves with it. This necessarily includes some reading of the built-in help manual and online support to learn its specific ways of displaying, entering and retrieving data. However, much will look familiar immediately to anyone experienced with the Mac OS and long-established principles of double-entry financial accounting. I have found the transition from Quicken to iBank much, much easier than the last big financial data migration I made about 2000, when my first Mac-based accounting program, which I used from 1985, Dollars & $ense, succumbed to the Y2K bug.

Overall, iBank version 4+ is already a great personal finance software application. I highly recommend it to any Mac users seeking flexible, powerful and up-to-date features in this class of software - especially those like me, who have been seeking a successor to Quicken for Mac 2007. As it does not have features like payroll, inventory and invoicing, or multi-user and network capability, it better suits personal and household financial record-keeping than business accounts. Mac users seeking a financial accounting package suitable for any but the smallest and least complicated businesses - which might be handled in iBank - need to look at more expensive software designed for business, like MYOB's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FirstEdge-for-Mac-Small-Business-Management-and-Accounting/dp/B000065ERY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FirstEdge for Mac - Small Business Management and Accounting</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Accountedge-for-Mac-Includes-Network-Edition/dp/B0039SPNFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Accountedge for Mac Includes Network Edition</a>, or Intuit's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/QuickBooks-for-Mac-2013-Download/dp/B008S0IV9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">QuickBooks for Mac 2013 [Download</a>].","I was using this software for several years and found helpful in reorganization of the existing software.

In order to E-file starting this year you must enter stock, bonds, options, or other investment assets sale data using the Premier version. Some potential buyers will miss this subtle change.

Thus, you may not share my dislike of the notion of time-limited subscriptions rather than true purchases.

That said, however, Symantec does deserve credit for several aspects of the latest version of Norton 360, and I recommend this suite despite some concerns that are spelled out below. This review is a ""peek under the hood,"" if you will, that avoids the marketing-speak surrounding the product so that you will have an idea of what to expect. I also address installation, since earlier versions caused more than a few users some headaches in terms of installation or modification.

I've put this product through its paces on a MacBook Pro, an older Mac and several mobile devices and have found it less quirky than its predecessors. I also like that it straddles many platforms without the purchase of platform-specific licenses. Before installing, you will want to think about privacy settings or help a young user understand those choices, but otherwise installation and configuration are pretty straightforward. However, I would prefer that it be sold rather than rented, and that product manuals be provided in physical form -- especially for those times when you're troubleshooting an existing problem and Internet accessibility and/or device behavior may be part of the issues with which you're coping.

Positives:
+ The most noteworthy feature of this version of Norton is that it covers your choice of up to five devices -- straddling multiple platforms, rather than past versions, where you'd have to buy two multi-user keys if you wanted to cover both PCs and Macs. Once you've activated your account and registration, you can authorize and deauthorize devices from within a Norton dashboard; this is a more savvy approach than a specific ""install"" quantity that may be problematic if you replace a device. Kindle users, this add/delete function is to device registration you've done when managing your Kindle account.

+ Installation is most easily accomplished online. Take note that one of the two pieces of paper in the product box specifically advises that you install from the Norton website rather than using the enclosed CD if you are working from a PC, a Mac, or a mobile Android or iOS device. (Other verbiage indicates that the CD is for use solely with a PC.)

+ Norton account: If you haven't used Norton or Symantec products in a while, you may need to establish a Norton account, as installation and settings all seem to be controlled when you are logged in. If you move quickly through the account setup, an easy way to find and modify your preferences is to access your newly established account by way of the confirmation e-mail Norton sends. Unless you like receiving offers, during the registration process you will need to opt out of receiving e-mails. Note that Norton groups promotional e-mails with messages about security-related messages so you can't differentiate.

+ This program provides access to a healthy 25 GB of cloud storage. If used with the usual cautions -- such as not storing items of a confidential nature, such as financial material - such storage can be a bonus. However, this really should not be anyone's sole method of backup, especially considering that it is tied to a time-limited subscription.

+ You will be able to establish varying levels of security based on your location and the way you connect to the Internet in these various settings. Although my preference would be to pre-configure rather than deal with making choices on the fly while trying to establish a connection from the road, the process is relatively streamlined.  Look for ""Location Awareness"" in the dashboard; choices are clearly explained.

+ Time from downloading the first small file in the setup process through generating a Norton account with a basic dashboard configuration, downloading the rest of the suite, and being able to conduct your first scan will probably surprise you with its brevity. My time over a relatively slow Ethernet connection was 10:52, and yours may well be quicker, especially if you have more robust connectivity and/or already have a Norton account.

+ Scanning is quicker than I remember with earlier versions of Norton, and runs unobtrusively in the background; it doesn't seem to slow down my work in other programs.

+ The interface guides you into activating various features as you proceed with your daily online activities. When you browse the Internet after activating your subscription, for example, it asks whether you want to activate the Safe Web browsing interface. Similarly, it offers you a chance to configure an interface when visiting Facebook. Especially for younger and/or more trusting users, these features are welcome, although in the case of Facebook, rather than promoting Norton, the default setting should be Facebook's most private custom setting of ""only me"" rather than the default ""public"" setting. (Again, this would be more understandable for freeware or shareware rather than a retail subscription model.)

+ File Guard. This allows you to select files that cannot be opened or modified without your permission, and functions similarly to password-protecting such files as PDFs. This is a positive for those who don't already  have a program that does so, but it requires several clicks to accomplish.

Concerns:
- As noted earlier, I dislike the subscription approach to software and utilities. Norton does seem to respond to folks who feel this way by making it possible to avoid auto-renewal, although it can take some sleuthing to find that setting (the easiest route I found was through the confirmation e-mail).

- The dashboard interface sacrifices transparency for the sake of oversimplification; expect to spend time digging for what you're seeking.

- There's a noticeable amount of in-product upsell, whether for additional cloud storage, additional device licenses, or renewal. I expect this in free or shareware products, and am finding the volume in a paid product to be increasingly intrusive.

- Early in the install process, there's a bit of fine print about the program conducting auto-updates. While that may be a useful default setting for a novice user or someone who prefers not to make these decisions, I dislike enabling anyone's product to write on my drives without telling me what it wants to write -- and why. Note: I haven't found a workaround to this situation, but will update if and when I do. If you have a solution, please share it in the comments.

- Symantec draws on an approach it dubs ""DeepSight"" to gather data on cyber-attackers and updates your application to protect you. That aspect is a positive; however, the program's default configuration is for your devices to ""submit security events"" to Symantec. Although a disclaimer notes that no personally identifying information is included, this setting really should be configured as an opt-in rather than an opt-out.","I'm a bit skeptical about this DRM utility that supposedly provides the same functionality but I do not like it anymore. I'm assuming this is a minor update since the release is out, but I think it is"
problem | year | product | hand | security | computer | install | hour | difference | turn | time | business | virus | date | ability | cleanup | program | thing,"I have been using Norton 360 since 2009 and never had a problem. I was unhappy to learn that there was only one more year for Norton 360 and it had been downgraded from the one I knew and trusted. Now for the product at hand. Do not install it unless you delete whatever Norton security that is on your computer or it will do it but it will lengthen your install by about an hour. The install itself is pretty straight forward. and I have installed it on four computers, one each of Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. Saw no real difference in the installs and it works well on all. I can not comment directly on whether as some have said it takes less resources and your computer in turn runs faster. Mine does, but I made other changes at about the same time. Due to this I can not say whether it was totally Norton. Like all Norton products, it goes about its business and protects your computer. I have it set up to automatically scan the computer which I never did before and it seems to work well. Unlike Norton 360 which told you when it last updated the virus definitions, it only tells you they are up to date or not. I had to call Norton to find this out as it is not obvious at least to me. You loose the ability to do Registry cleanup which was great after you deleted a program. Everyone who buys this product should complain to Norton, maybe they might put it back as it should be. The best thing is that it can be used on any wired or wireless product you have.","I had a problem with this product for about 1 year. I had a problem with mine for about 1 year.

The truth is that many of the pop culture artifacts that have seeped into our consciousness earned their place not by being very good but by being very repetitive. There are many, many shows I watched not because I was interested in them but because you couldn't swing a television remote without catching Happy Days, The Brady Bunch, The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, etc. If you were a kid on a Saturday morning, this meant you couldn't avoid Land of the Lost.

Land of the Lost was never very good, but it didn't matter to me: It was the only way I was going to see monsters on television. Back then, any monster special effects were relegated to the big screen, and since I wasn't allowed to see most movies that featured them Land of the Lost was the only way I was going to see dinosaurs - even if they were poorly animated puppets or claymation. So you better believe I watched every bizarre episode I could, even if it never made any sense, the acting was frequently terrible, and the sets, costumes, and actors looked like they were made of rubber.

Producers who decide to update these nostalgia icons have a choice: revamp the terrible show with utter seriousness (think ""Lost in Space"") or shamelessly mock it instead. ""Land of the Lost"" chooses to mock its source material.

The problem is that it's not a loving mockery made by fans. It's clear the producers didn't do their homework. Oh they got some things right - they mimic the look-and-feel of the Sleestaks, of Cha-Ka, and Grumpy the dinosaur (sans claymation). But the innocent wonder is replaced with a smarmy, cynical approach that makes Will Ferrell out to be kind of a jerk.

The three main characters are paleontologist Rick Marshall (Ferrell), student Holly Cantrell (Anna Friel, sporting a variety of tight t-shirts), and randomly inserted gift shop owner and foil to Marshall, Will Stanton (Danny McBride). They fall through a wormhole, they have to get back, Sleestaks, dinosaurs, yadda-yadda, the end. Marshall's rivalry with Matt Lauer (as himself) over the existence of time warps is the funniest thing about the film.

Ferrell, who pretty much plays the same character in whatever movie he's in, doesn't have a warm cast to temper his antics. Instead he goes through a series of contrived set-ups with a punch line that ends in dinosaur excrement. This joke is used no less than three times. Scriptwriter Chris Henchy needs to find some new material.

And that's the thing. If you're not familiar with the original TV series, this is just another semi-amusing entry in Ferrell's oeuvre with dinosaurs thrown in. But the whole point of reimagining the series was to lure those fans back into the theater, and instead they ended up with a bunch of dino poop.","I'm a huge fan of the 80's pop culture, and I'm sure you all will too.

Depends on your needs.  If you are starting from scratch and looking for an all-in-one media package to do any or all of its commonly associated tasks (ripping and burning cd's, basic image enhancing, video editing, dvd authoring, etc.) then this program may be a good starting point for you provided that you can purchase it with a nicely discounted price.  For users who are thinking about upgrading from previous iterations of this program perhaps its time to start looking anew as most of the upgrades from versions 8 or 9 are somewhat minimal and not essential in my books.

One of the chief problems with this software suite is that while it excels at providing a solution for just about every media task the average home user needs on their computers the truth of the matter is that with a bit of digging around their are far better (and oftentimes free) software out there that makes some of Roxio's package seem awkward and out of date.  For instance, why bother with Roxio's music management system when iTunes is available for free as well as Google's Picassa for photo management?

This is the only Nancy Drew game that takes place in the past- in the 1930s.  It's also probably the easiest of the Nancy Drew games I've played.  Nancy undertakes to help her orphaned friend Emily, who has inherited her mother's inn, and fallen into a deep state of melancholy.  The inn has been experiencing strange accidents, and it's up to Nancy to figure them out.  The puzzles in this game were a bit easier than the standard Nancy Drew fare.  Also, there weren't as many locations to investigate as some other ND games.  In particular, there's very little to do in the inn, and one of the things ND games do so well is to set up spooky, old, searchable houses.  That said, the game is still fun, and this is a great ND game to start with, if one is new to the genre.","I am a diehard aficionado.

If only it were as successful in capturing audio files and video images!

There is very little that Roxio does that can't be done by using the programs--Tunes, iDVD, iMovie, iPhoto, Disk Utility--included with purchase of a Mac computer.  Although Apple's programs and applications are comparatively accessible and user-friendly, Toast showcases them in a way that makes them seem more ""instant,"" if not automatic.  Unfortunately the Toast ""short-cuts"" end up being more of a hassle than a time-saver, and I end up burning my CDs in iTunes and downloading external software for editing video (or simply turn the project over to a ""dedicated"" VHS to DVD conversion machine--which can often be purchased for twice the price of the Toast program).

My biggest disappointment with Toast for the past several editions has been the Spin Doctor program, which is bundled in every edition apparently  unchanged from preceding editions. I've tried numerous times to record sound from my computer via Toast's included electronic ""patch cord,"" alleged to link your computer's audio output with its audio input (especially critical now that Apple has eliminated the ""Audio In"" port from the new iMacs).  Just as often, I've given up on this undependable, erratic feature, and removed it from my machine (even though it refuses to be deleted from my machine's library).

More seriously, the audio wave forms, which are so important for accurate, precise (and undetectable) editing aren't up to the task.  As colorful as the automatically extracted tracks from an LP are, they're never sufficiently precise to replace a good $20 dollar wave editing program.  If I wish to digitize an LP, delete or insert a 12-bar chorus of an improvised solo (without missing a beat), or set up a timed recording of an FM broadcast, I'm much more likely to realize quick and effective results by downloading a program like Sound Studio (or free software like Audacity).

Toast has the cosmetics down.  If they would address functionality in the next edition, beginning with Spin Doctor, offering a USB interface (equal to iMic's or  Behringer's along with wave forms that can be easily read and precisely edited), the program could prove a pleasure to use--and a practical tool.

As far as I could tell, at most one core is used by Dragon Dictate, though.

The attached video shows the speed of recognition after voice training by reading the phrases in just the first and simplest voice training scheme.  I read some paragraphs from an advanced equine anatomy text and everything was typed perfectly.  I was truly amazed, not just in comparison with Apple and Google internet-based recognition (which do not involve training) - but in comparison to the last time I evaluated speech recognition using a trained product, several years ago.

The pluses for me include:

1.  A profile is created for each user-microphone combination.  This profile can then be voice-trained by reading scripts to improve accuracy.  Five script scenarios are included, and all five can be done if one wants to really tune things.  I found amazing results after doing just one script.

2.  Individual words can be added and trained, so that names and technical terms will be recognized accurately.  This is easily done via the Vocabulary Editor.

3.  I can speak really quickly and the result is still accurate

4.  Dictation can be into pretty much any application.

5.  Voice commands can be used to control apps, but I have little personal interest in that.  It would be extremely helpful for someone with limited eyesight, coordination, or other physical limitations.

6.  A variety of microphones, including smartphones, can be used for dictation.  Sound files from phones and voice recorders can be transcribed.  A corded USB microphone is included in the box.

7. Efficient voice selection and correction of text

The negatives for me include:

a.  Transcription of a sound file (from a voice recording) can only proceed if a profile (trained voice/microphone pair) is loaded.  Dictate will ONLY load a profile if the corresponding microphone is connected.  Tech support says this is as-designed.  But, it is incredibly stupid when the microphone is neither needed nor used during a transcription process.  The effect is that if you have a sound file containing someone else's voice, and they've trained a profile with a microphone that you do not have, you cannot transcribe the file.

b.  Special vocabulary is saved per-profile, so you have to re-enter all special words (and then re-train) for each microphone that you might use.

c.  The user interface seems really illogical.  I've attached an image to the product at the top of the page showing that there is a red 'Stop' octagon when the microphone is off.  Clicking it does not stop dictation ... it STARTS it.... turning the symbol to a green circle.  The green then means 'go' ... speak and Dragon Dictate will transcribe or respond to commands.  Clicking the green circle restores the red stop sign.  This seems backwards to me, but that's just me:  I would think that clicking the stop icon would STOP recording and clicking the green circle would START it.  If thinking of status lights, most recorders have a red light when they are recording / broadcasting and no light when inactive.  I can't get my head around what Nuance was thinking here.

d.  A variety of actions in the tutorial would not function, particularly spelling mode.

e.  It is challenging to type words that are also Dragon commands.  For example, whether I pause before and after ""new line"" or say it all together within a sentence, the words are never types ... instead a line break is always created.  I can fake it by pausing on either side of ""new"" and then either side of ""line"", but the instructions say that this is unnecessary.  Dracton Dictate has so many built-in commands, that you never know which ones will be obeyed versus typed, so you need to watch your output as you speak until getting used to it.  Personally, I'd like the ability to create a profile in which I disable all commands I never intend to use.

Bottom line:

Useful?  Depends on your typing skills vs verbal skills.  I can type extremely quickly and (usually) accurately and compose best while typing.  Others I know, while reasonable typists, think better when voicing their thoughts aloud, and one friend is particularly interested in Dragon Dictate to get some rough drafts onto paper because of her vocal process.  For those who are slow or poor typists, or who have some physical limitation, I think Dragon Dictate is an excellent value.  For those on Mountain Lion, which includes free internet-based dictation from Apple, the choice will be more personal.  The Apple dictation requires a live internet connection and is not voice-trained, and hence is less accurate; it also does not support voice correction or voice command.  There are audiences for the free Mountain Lion feature as well as for the more powerful Dragon product - I'd suggest first trying the free Mountain Lion feature and if it satisfies your needs, great; if not, take a look at Dragon Dictate 3.

UPDATE 11/30/12:  I would take a star off this review based on the absolutely horrible Nuance customer support.  I've never encountered a more useless system - slow web response,  keeps invalidating my support account, preventing access followed by inability to re-activate the account with the logged cases...and staff which give stock responses that do not address the question asked.  Terrible customer experience leaving me feeling pretty negative about Nuance as a company.

Latest tech support response (unbelievable to me):  Asking them why the built-in microphone on Apple's LED Cinema Displays is not recognized by Dragon Dictate, this is the response:  ""Dragon Dictate requires a mic that has a type that is USB. Go to System Preferences > sound > input. What is the ""Apple LED Cinema Display"" connection ""type?"". If it is not USB, What type is it?""  In other words:  they did not even test Apple's hardware for a Mac product.",I was really disappointed that AstraZene discontinued this product because this is a huge space. I can see it written on the back of the laptop when I am not using it. It gives a fast reading of the anatomy.

The program was driving me crazy.  Now after two months of using it, I believe Corel has done a good job with this program. Yes it does not compare to Photoshop but that is like comparing apples to oranges. Paintshop Pro really competes with photoshop elements and as a user of that product also, I will admit Paintshop Pro is better.

The install process does a take a while but so most applications in this field.  The first thing I did after installation was run an update.. I highly recommend this when using Corel's prodcuts.  I have some bad experiences a few of there other programs.

The interface is nice but is not real user friendly, so it does require extra time to learn what features are availble to you.  Corel has gone down the same path as other and uses a black interface.

Using the product
One the first thing the app wants to do is scan your computer images. I pointed towards my folder stucture that I use with lightroom. The organizer is easy to use and has a good feel to it.

When it came to editing photos this is where I struggled at first.  Photoshop Elememts is defintely easier but does not have as many edit capabilites. Corel did include some one step fix features but I believe they did not work well enough for me, I wanted more control. When I ran the one step photo fix I felt the photo became to overexposed and needed tweeking.

With HDR Imagery being the rage lately, Corel included it in X3.  It does not produce the result I like from HDR and does not give enough control like Photomatix.  I am going knock Corel for this because I was suprised to see it even included.

Performacnce wise I did not experienceany real slowness but I am running Intel I Core.  If you have any older computer you may experience slowness, I base this off pf past experiences with the Corel software.

I would definitely recommend this to friends and family with understanding there may be some frustration in the beginning because it is not as easy as Photoshop Elements to use.

I am also a SOLO IT Director for a small, multi-million dollar business. We need Office. There is no way around it. VBA and Excel is a small business' best friend. For the casual users these days, that is hard to say, especially if a lot of people are happy with JUST a Smart Phone. But that is another discussion for another time. Is Office still a great choice? YES.

The first thing you will notice and these days, you don't get much on media. Everything has pretty much moved to download. Office 2016 is no exception. Depending on your speeds, downloads can take a good while. But installation was pretty easy. Activation can be a tad convoluted but just pay attention to the screen prompts.

I am a heave Excel user, so I spent the bulk of my time with it and digging into all of its features. It was fast and for the most part stable. One thing I've noticed in my small business environment, is that since the last batch of updates from Microsoft, VBA has been acting a little strange and so solution from Microsoft yet. Mostly when it deals with attacking an external XLA file to an Excel project when other sheets are open. The other apps are also quite good and I for one am a fan of the Ribbon. It is very functional and useful.

Office 2016 is focused on the cloud for sure but you can still save locally. It is as good idea to set up OneDrive, if you use it. DO note, the 1TB of OneDrive Space only applies if you use Office 365.

Which bring me to Office 365. Do you need a standalone Office copy these days? For us in a small business, yes. We looked into Office 365 and while we do use it for E-Mail, Skype for Business and SharePoint, it was too expensive up front to include Office. And a lot of people do not want recurring charges. Office 365 for the home user is a great value but standalone versions of office are still functional and you don't have to worry about the yearly renewal.

Office is still the king of functionality on both the PC and the Mac.",I had a hard time at the office and I was happy that I was able to buy it here. I was a big dollar business and went on a trip to Mexico where everyone would be nice to have a few dollars

WinVISTA is far WORSE than the initial release of WinXP: NUMEROUS and MAJOR compatibility problems with most third-party Software, Games (well, all games except...HALO2), GFX-Cards, Scanners & Printers, Cameras & USB-Peripherals. Not to mention Microsoft Software!

Even MICROSOFT Software (such as STREETS & TRIPS 2007, ENCARTA 2007, PICTURE-IT or MONEY 2007) refuses to work with WinVISTA!

WordPerfect used to be considered the bastard cousin of MS Word, and some of the reputation was deserved.  In the early days, MS Word had shiny new features, an easier user interface, and was the defacto standard in the Windows world.  I don't believe that's the case anymore, especially with this version of WordPerfect.

For one, the interface is clean and lean, and you can customize the look and feel of WP to suit your needs. I find the ribbon in MS Word to take up too much real estate, and not nearly as customizable as I'd like it.

Also, WP now plays well with everyone.  You can open and save docs in MS Word format, and even interchange between free word processing software like Libre and Open Office.  I find no difference in speed, and the user interface is intuitive.

Otherwise, Norton Small Business (""NSB"") detects, removes old at the installation, and blocks well new viruses from accessing through email, downloading, or copying, has a small initial footprint, but does not uninstall completely and leaves a residue interfering with superseding security programs, which requires a special uninstalling program from the Internet. NSB is constantly up-to-date. It works fast and in the background, and allows manual customization in case of an atypical computer setup. A description of virtually every case can be found on the Internet.

Initially, NSB takes up less than 100 MB of memory (RAM) that is much less than the competitors. However, not all memory (RAM) used to monitor the running programs is freed after closing them. But, it tends to slowly increase memory retention during or after using especially Web browsers. That so called memory leakage might drain away memory causing the computer to slow down to a crawl and theoretically even to a halt (crash). However, it is unlikely and would be unnoticeable at worst in and thus irrelevant to modern, multi-core computers with min. 4 GB of RAM (memory).

It has many more features and included add-ins than I'll ever need. For example - multi-camera features are cool but I doubt I'll ever use more than 2 cameras. Still it's nice to have the option. The same for a lot of the other advanced capabilities. Motion follow is already a very useful for me.

The program comes with a limited time access to on-line training. I have only dipped my figurative toe into these lessons but I think most new video editors will find the training a very helpful quick start and introduction to video editing using Pinnacle Studio. I think this is a thoughtful plus, but the time-limited access is just plain strange. Happily there are lots of helpful youtube videos too.

Somehow it bugs me when a program has a shopping cart built-in. It's like you are expected to get add-ons to really use the program. For example, a major feature is 4K and HD editing. Does it make sense that Blu-Ray burning should be an extra cost $7.99 add-on you can only purchase through the program? Probably this does not push other folks buttons like it does mine.

Here is what I like:
+ Easy to use interface (coming from Adobe Premiere)
+ Limited-time access to online training is useful
+ Performs well with reasonably quick user interface
+ Reads/writes every format I could want
+ Motion follow for text has been very handy!
+ A large number of transitions and effects are included
+ Tracking effects (like blur and following text) are helpful

Here is what I don't so much:
- Blu-Ray burning requires a $7.99 add-in

I like when software gets regular updates. I installed the latest patch today:  V20.1.0 released 2016-10-26. Here is a summary  of its changes:
* Resolved black or flickering preview
* NewBlueFX: Watermarks removed
* Resolved error messages that displayed when editing titles
* Resolved crashes in Slideshow projects
* Sample project is now removable
* New! Added audio-specific fade transition (Audio Cross Fade)

In conclusion, I think Pinnacle Studio 20 Ultimate is a very nice video editing package at an affordable price point. It is feature rich with a very usable interface. It seems intuitive to me after using Adobe Premiere. Performance seems pretty good to me on my desktop with lots of RAM. It bugs me that an add-on is required to burn a Blu-ray and the program has a built-in shopping cart.

The annoyances are minor compared to the overall value of the program. Amazon does not give half stars and I don't think that I can really take a full star off so 5 stars is my rating.

It took quite a long time to install, but surprisingly there doesn't seem to be a marked slowness when he surfs the web during a scan.  This program allows you to schedule scans when you want them & you can set the scan priority too. Setting 'scan priority' to high is the quickest way to scan, but will slow down the performance of your PC if you use it during the scan.  I set his laptop at 'user sensitive' which will take longer to finish a scan while he's using his laptop but will cause minimal slowness for him...then when he's not using his laptop the scan will run at 'high priority' & finish quicker.  This is a great feature.  The 'whole' computer scan took 1hr, 19 min, 22 sec, to finish using  the 'user sensitive' scan priority.

Although the AVG security toolbar takes up more room than he'd like, its built-in LinkScanner function will show the site's safety rating. It also will show the safety rating of search results when you search using Yahoo, Google, or Bing/MSN.

A normal scan will not detect or remove rootkits so be sure to run the AntiRoot Kit scan, found in Scan Options, manually to protect your PC from this malware. (One thing a rootkit might do is steal your passwords) The AntiRoot Kit scan took 4 min 31 sec on my husband's laptop.

Identity Protection makes sure your passwords, credit card numbers, banking account numbers, etc, are safe. If it detects a problem, it will shut down the process.

This program has many features which are fully explained in Amazon's Product Description. I haven't experienced any difficulties & will update my review if my opinion of this program changes.","I am a regular user of the Palm Professionnel laptop.

So far, it hasn't bitten me back and I'm slowly learning the curve of the program without being angry or annoyed.

Installation was very easy. No issues installing it to my Windows 10 PC. I also like that they made registering the product relatively fuss free. In addition to the program, when you register the product, you get additional online bonuses like 20GB of cloud storage and access to extra online content.

I've barely scratched the surface of Cyberlink's Power Director's ability. In my novice fumblings, I've played with the wizard features to help me quickly create an attractive format for my video. The program can utilize both photo and video media files to create your own movie.

When you're ready to publish, you have a choice of formats to choose from. The program also has quick settings for different device and different online services. I can upload directly to YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, Daily Motion, and others. The process went quite fast for me. Once I created my 3 minute short video in an HD format, it was rendered in a short time. The uploading to Facebook actually took longer than rendering, but it did upload properly and was available quickly.

What got me annoyed so far, when I use the Wizard help, some of the photos were cropped too tight. Even with the special effects zooming out or similar, the majority of the photos in my video were cropped much closer than needed to. Lots of good parts of my photos ended up getting cropped out. Other than than, it still managed to make a great video out of my photographs.

Once you start poking around in PowerDirector, you'll find new, cool, different, techie features that get your imagination going. You can create 3D movies, have 4K resolution, precision motion tracking, and more. It's all rather exciting.

It's a cool program. It has its quirks with the Wizard feature but still manages to create enjoyable movies to watch.",I'm a techie who wants to hide behind a huge section of space and I'm sure there's a mini-video camera with a decent img. It's great for beginners who want to

The main selling point for me was the 6 months of Ancestry.com membership. I was nervous it would be for new users only, but, nope! Totally works on established members.

The software seemlessly integrates Ancestry.com family trees with FTM family trees. FMT is a great partner program for people who like to do mass editing offline and then upload that info in one shot.

I'm really happy with the software and will continue using it after my subscription has expired.","I stopped using Software Development Kit when I was younger.
